1,i would probably not have bothered to comment on this film if i had not been disturbed by the constant references made to it here in north america as a porn film  our obsession with what is  or should be  regarded as pornographic remains a relic of the 'guidance' provided to film makers by the hayes committee many  many years ago and it is now really time that we relegate it to the past  so far we have not progressed far beyond establishing a somewhat arbitrary division between what we now term 'soft' and 'hard' porn  with both carrying the same pornography label  it is time for us all recognise that neither the r rated soft porn  release version of this film  nor the unrated version hard porn  available on dvd were in any way pornographic in legal terms pornography is defined by its capacity to deprave or corrupt  many classic books such as lady chatterley's lover  fanny hill  women in love  the story of 'o' or moll flanders have been prosecuted for pornographic content  tried by jury and cleared on the basis of this definition  but in practice most ordinary citizens are not interested in what they regard as legal equivocation  and apply a simpler test that is rather too stringent when applied to books or films which are very close to the line  but serves to quickly clear most others from any taint of pornography  although the hayes code would have rated aiw as unacceptable both for nudity and for its depictions of sexual activities  in practice most people today accept that where the basic message of a book or film is clearly designed to encourage the development of long term stable family relationships in which the participants find real fulfillment  it cannot be regarded as pornographic this does not mean that works depicting unsatisfactory or unstable relationships should be recognised as pornographic  only that these may need a more sophisticated assessment  in aiw  we have a film about a young female librarian who has had a rather sheltered upbringing  and keeps her suitor at arms length because of a feeling that this is what morality requires her to do  after he gets too frustrated by this and threatens to leave her  she falls asleep and dreams she is transported to a wonderland closely based on that of lewis carrol where everyone she meets is totally uninhibited about their sexual needs  she is shocked  but is a kind person who takes things as she finds them  so before long she finds her own prejudices gradually melting away  she wakes up when her boyfriend returns to break off their affair  but her attitude to him has changed so completely that their relationship is fully restored  and the film ends with them living 'happily ever after' with their children in a home with a white picket fence and a family dog  an ending clearly directed to those romantics who remain very young at heart pornographic   hardly  suitable viewing for children   well probably not quite  unless they have very progressive parents r rating   pg would be more appropriate today entertaining for viewers in most age groups   yes  but the film has its faults  these are discussed in many of the comments here on imdb  however

promising young actress  but today the film appears to be on its way to becoming a cult classic  several home video productions have been released in both vhs and dvd format  the last was a dvd

0,i'd have to say that i've seen worse sci fi channel originals  but this nu image shonker from yossi wein was still quite a drag  the big problem with it is that it simply isn't convincing  not just its creature  but acting  writing and any attempts at drama  the direction lacks any kind of flair and the script from boaz davidson and danny lerner never really works  predictable  often laughable  whilst it delivers less howlers than a fair few of these sorts of films it never offers anything to engage or raise the pulse  the actors do their best  but with such material their workmanlike efforts have little effect  matthew reilly burke is a blandly watchable hero  meredith morton similar as a blandly watchable love interest  actually she was a bit less convincing but at least she was easy on the eyes  the film at least has the dignity to bowl along at a reasonable pace  but its biggest plus is that the octopus isn't entirely cgi rendered  so even though it doesn't look good  at least there are a few legit scenes of characters inanely grappling with rubbery tentacles in pretty amusing fashion  i also chuckled at the disparities between different representations of the octopus  the cgi shots of the creature as a whole vary over the course of the film  they are also different not only in size but appearance to the practical shots of it  and there are scenes where the tentacle action suggests that the makers had abandoned pretending they were making a film about an octopus and just envisioned their creature as a bunch of miscellaneous tentacles  the scenes of the creature attacking people get old pretty swiftly  but there are a few funny scenes where it takes on other things  like a boat and a crane  yes  these scenes are poor  but they did make me chuckle  undisputable highlight though is a hilarious sequence in which the octopus takes on a new york landmark  the scene may not be much more than a minute but it really is inspired  and well worth looking up on youtube  apart from that things are uninspired all round  a pg level lack of gore or nastiness stops this one from even pulling off much in the trash good times the film does take a turn into semi gripping disaster movie territory at the end  but i can't really give it credit because the best shots in the last few scenes were culled from the stallone flick daylight which by my recollection is quite good  altogether this was pretty rubbishy stuff and not something i'd really recommend to anyone except creature feature die hards  better than a poke in the eye with a wet stick  but not by

0,i picked this movie up because it sounded like a pretty decent flick  and i've always been a fan of foreign films  however  for someone who likes movies  i was surprised at how much i hate  hate  hated this movie although it does aim to expose the lives of young  lowerclass men in lima  and to an extent it does succeeed  the characters are hopelessly shallow and the audience winds up having absolutely no feelings whatsoever for them although the story chiefly revolves around m  he rarely ever speaks  and his dialouge is  at best  amazingly dry and dull  warning  some small spoilers basically  the story revolves around a young man named m who has been searching for jobs  but without success he does gain employment twice  but quits because they're not for him when you're poor  the last option you have is to be picky  some amount of time is spent with his friends  who's idea of fun is to rape a little year old  steal crappy tires off a piece of shit car for a dime sack of weed  and several other slightly retarded activities m's friend comesup with a plan to make  a piece and move to the us by running cocaine to miami  when the drug lord gives them a job  we're treated to an extremely lame scene of the three friends buying clothes at the mall with some music playing in the background  we see them trying different clothes on like little girls given  to shop  get there hair

always been a fan of foreign films  however  for someone who likes movies  i was surprised at how much i hate  hate  hated this movie although it does aim to expose the lives of young  lowerclass men in lima  and to an extent it does succeeed  the characters are hopelessly shallow and the audience winds up having absolutely no feelings whatsoever for them although the story chiefly revolves around m  he rarely ever speaks  and his dialouge is  at best  amazingly dry and dull  warning  some small spoilers basically  the story revolves around a young man named m who has been searching for jobs  but without success he does gain employment twice  but quits because they're not for him when you're poor  the last option you have is to be picky  some amount of time is spent with his friends  who's idea of fun is to rape a little year old  steal crappy tires off a piece of shit car for a dime sack of weed  and several other slightly retarded activities m's friend comesup with a plan to make  a piece and move to the us by running cocaine to miami  when the drug lord gives them a job  we're treated to an extremely lame scene of the three friends buying clothes at the mall with some music playing in the background  we see them trying different clothes on like little girls given  to shop  get there hair cut  and then strutting off looking like slick gangsters one character  carlos  will

loudly complains to cooper about his perceived penury at the hands of his family  including his daughter  anita louise  i am a fan of all actors  frank morgan is to my mind a hollywood treasure  cooper a legend  and louise a very lovely  versatile and underappreciated actress seldom seen in the leading role  i also have nothing against teresa wright  and while not blessed with great range  she usually delivers heartwarming performances from a promising opening  the story slides downhill all the way to the end  i found nothing humorous about burning down the home of cooper's wouldbe inlaws  the butler in such a fastidious  nonsmoking household would never just blithely walk away  allowing cooper to continue smoking  or alternatively he would certainly supply him with some means of disposing of his illtimed cigarette  moreover  nobody with any common sense would permit himself to be left holding a lit cigarette without asking for some means of disposing of it  and finally  nobody in his right mind crushes out a cigarette in a handkerchief and sticks it in his pocket  this whole sequence just made cooper seem foolish and gauche  it is a poor contrivance  ill conceived and filmed in a way that induces ridicule not laughter  the forced medical examination of cooper is equally contrived  nobody lets himself undergo a complete medical examination without his being advised of its purpose or giving his consent  that cooper did so is too removed from reality to be funny  it's absurd  stealing babies from hospitals is a serious legal offense  and that  too  is nothing to laugh about  finally  the scenes of cooper's overly fastidious  neurotic attention to his baby's feeding and weight may have struck a nerve with a few people who have experienced anxiety over their own newborn babies  but to me they just seem tedious and slow  the wardrobe and prop departments went over the top in those scenes  while paradoxically  the script writer went to sleep the lines are just not in the script to generate humor  they just miss on all cylinders  the laughs come not a mileaminute  but more like a light yearaminute  the only time the movie has any energy or humor is when frank morgan is on camera the scene that is totally wasted is when both of cooper's love interests and their respective fathers are cooped up in the same hotel room together  there is probably a rich vein of humor somewhere in that mine  but none of it was extracted in the end  one of the two very likable girls is going to get hurt  predictably  it is the anita louise character  who gets jilted on her wouldbewedding night  while it is not on camera  that is her fate  and it is not particularly funny  even as a loose end  she hadn't done anything in this film to make me unsympathetic unlike gail patrick  say  in my favorite wife  consequently  i was expecting perhaps hoping is a better word in the context of the film  for anita louise to enjoy a happy ending  too  the fact that such a nice character is essentially wiped out at the movie's end really undermines the effect of the happy ending for cooper and wright i kept waiting for something to happen  for the

1,streisand fans only familiar with her work from the funny girl film onwards need to see this show to see what a brilliant performer streisand was  before she achieved her goal of becoming a movie star  there had never been a female singer quite like her ever before  and there never would be again sorry  celine  only in your dreams   but never again would streisand sing with the vibrancy  energy  and  above all  the enthusiasm and vulnerability with which she performs here  by the time she gets to that central park concert only or years later  she'd been filming funny girl in hollywood and her performing style has become less spontaneous and more reserved  more rehearsed and  let's face it  more angry  there's a wall between her and the audience  live performing was never what she really enjoyed  she did it because she knew it was her ticket to hollywood  and once she no longer had to do it she's done it as little as possible and oh  that legendary stage fright provides such a good excuse  her vocals here and on her earlier judy garland show appearance are incredible  streisand could truly make an old song sound new again  and composers such as richard rodgers and harold arlen loved her for it  but by the s streisand was trying to be a rock singer  her albums pandering to the younger audiences  with overwrought shrieking of songs that were unworthy of her effort or her voice  in the 's she came back with that brilliant broadway album  but went on and on about what a struggle it was to get it done  how they told her not to do it  etc  oh please  when has anyone told streisand what to do  she could have been doing good stuff like that all along  bringing audiences up to her level instead of stooping to what she thought the young public wanted  the back to broadway sequel wasn't nearly as good  as streisand seems to feel it necessary to improve on other composers' work  if he were alive at the time  would richard rodgers have even recognized his own some enchanted evening rodgers  notorious for taking singers to task for playing around with his melodies  would undoubtedly have been after streisand to sing what he'd written  she also blows michael crawford off the cd in their duet of music of the night  apparently reminding him just whose cd this is  why does she insist on taking songs that are duets and singing them by herself  and songs that aren't duets and singing them as duets with someone else who she then goes on to diminish supposedly judy garland took streisand aside and advised her  don't let them do to you what they did to me  advice streisand wasted no time in heeding  despite her protestations to the contrary  surely it looks like it's always been her way or the highway  just imagine  she told the cbs brass how her first tv special would be done  no guests  just her but nobody can argue with the results that are so evident here  treat yourself to this brilliant musical phenomenon before she was a legend  you'll be absolutely amazed at the difference ps  i watched this again last night    after not having seen it for many years  it was even better than i remembered  the st act begins with i'm late and includes make believe and how does the wine taste  and barbra's homage to childhood  i'm five  it climaxes as streisand appears with full and i mean full orchestra to sing people  she wasn't bored with the song yet and although it's a somewhat shorter rendition it really soars  compare it to some of her later autopilot versions  the nd act after streisand's kooky schtickpatter  which hasn't changed much over the years is the famous series of depression songs set amidst the extravagance of bergdorfgoodman's the rd act is the stunner  call it streisand  the orchestra  and the audience although we never see the audience that supposedly witness this historic event  with her fear of audiences and dislike of such performing  this may have been the toughest part for her  but if so  to her credit it doesn't show  she tears through lover come back to me and the torchy when the sun comes out though i can't remember in which order   the poignant why did i choose you  one of my alltime favorite streisand performances and offers a medley of funny girl songs  including of course don't rain on my parade and my favorite song from the score  the music that makes me dance explaining that fanny brice sang a song like that in and it made her the toast of broadway streisand then sings my man and it's almost a dressrehearsal template for her later screen rendition in the funny girl film the main difference being that the black gown here is sleeveless  her film gown had long sleeves and against the black background all we saw were her hands and face  but the vocal here is more urgent and charged than her later film vocal  her performance of the song has everything to do with streisand and nothing to do with fanny brice who  of course  never sang the song in such an allout manner as streisand does here or in the film  see the great ziegfield for a glimpse of brice's more understated version  the show ends with streisand singing happy days are here again over the credits when it was over i said to the friend i was watching it with  she has never  ever  done anything better and she was twentythree years old ,0.7576837539672852,1,streisand fans only familiar with her work from

someone else who she then goes on to diminish supposedly judy garland took streisand aside and advised her  don't let them do to you what they did to me  advice streisand wasted no time in heeding  despite her protestations to the contrary  surely it looks like it's always been her way or the highway  just imagine  she told the cbs brass how her first tv special would be done  no guests  just her but nobody can argue with the results that are so evident here  treat yourself to this brilliant musical phenomenon before she was a legend  you'll be absolutely amazed at the difference ps  i watched this again last night    after not having seen it for many years  it was even better than i remembered  the st act begins with i'm late and includes make believe and how does the wine taste  and barbra's homage to childhood  i'm five  it climaxes as streisand appears with full and i mean full orchestra to sing people  she wasn't bored with the song yet and although it's a somewhat shorter rendition it really soars  compare it to some of her later autopilot versions  the nd act after streisand's kooky schtickpatter  which hasn't changed much over the years is the famous series of depression songs set amidst the extravagance of bergdorfgoodman's the rd act is the stunner  call it streisand  the orchestra  and the audience although we never see the audience that supposedly witness this historic event  with her fear of audiences and dislike of such performing  this may have been the toughest part for her  but if so  to her credit it doesn't show  she tears through lover come back to me and the torchy when the sun comes out though i can't remember in which order   the poignant why did i choose you  one of my alltime favorite streisand performances and offers a medley of funny girl songs  including of course don't rain on my parade and my favorite song from the score  the music that makes me dance explaining that fanny brice sang a song like that in and it made her the toast of broadway streisand then sings my man and it's almost a dressrehearsal template for her later screen rendition in the funny girl film the main difference being that the black gown here is sleeveless  her film gown had long sleeves and against the black background all we saw were her hands and face  but the vocal here is more urgent and charged than her later film vocal  her performance of the song has everything to do with streisand and nothing to do with fanny brice who  of course  never sang the song in such an allout manner as streisand does here or in the film  see the great ziegfield for a glimpse of brice's more understated version  the show ends with streisand singing happy days are here again over the credits when it was over i said to the friend i was watching it with  she has never  ever  done anything better and she was twentythree years old ,0.7576837539672852,0,0.0,N,0.0,0,0

1,there is a serious scene in this movie  a scene that lets you know that his film won't be pulling many cheap punches  it takes place in a crowded train station and the protagonists are ambushed by assassins with automatic weapons  they make a break for it and just manage to get out in a hail of gunfire  the main hall of the train station is now filled with corpses of innocent people that were caught in the crossfire  some would call that too sad and  or grim to put into what is supposed to be an enjoyable action flick  i call it honesty  most action movies tend to lean toward the safe side of showing violence and plot elements  this mostly means that in spite massive shootouts innocent people tend not to die or at least we don't see them die  the violence is all purely the good guys versus the bad guys with mainly the bad guys dying  a bit of common sense clearly shows this to be absurd renny harlin showed a hint of this in his first and sadly only hit  die hard the villains intentionally crash a plane full of people to get their point across  the scene was also filmed with a backup scene of a cargo plane with only a few people onboard going down  but the grimmer and probably more realistic scenario ended up being used  however  to fit the spirit of the first film  die hard was mostly a fun action movie  here  that grimmer and more convincing edge is pervasive  the violence is bloody  the one liners are hilarious  but with a certain style that more echoes natural human sarcasm than clichéd film wisecracks at key moments of action  the plot is also packed with more malicious intent than most action films  the villain is not just some rogue out for revenge or a mad grab at power  it is less ridiculous  but also more frightening than that  from recent films  the bourne trilogy almost gets there with its less cheesy than usual action film style  but this film is from and years before the bourne identity with matt damon made it to the big screen another interesting aspect is that the main hero is actually a heroine  and this is well before the movie version of tomb raider became a hit  what's more is that this heroine genuinely looks like she could take down john mcclane and then take his still lit cigarette  this movie marks geena davis's second actionheroine role and she still didn't manage to score a hit  while angelina jolie stars in tomb raider years later and scores a hit  the reasons are beyond me  completely lastly  this movie isn't all dark edged  there are many outrageous and spectacular set pieces that one can only see in

easy to understand why this one just doesn't fly  the one saving grace of the film is the performance by warren keith as shelby  whose subtle delivery is convincing  and which in and of itself is fairly humorous  the effectiveness of it is diminished  however  inasmuch as keith has to share his scenes with kornbluth  which somewhat automatically cancels out his positive contributions to the project  shumaker and sarah overman julie faustino also manage to keep their heads above water with their respective performances  which are commendable  if not entirely memorable  they at least make their scenes watchable  and overman even manages to elevate kornbluth's performance  if only momentarily  but it's still not enough to save the day or the film  the supporting cast includes amy resnick  mindy   brian thorstenson  clifford   june lomena  davonne   joe bellan jimmy the mail clerk  with a cameo appearance by a disheveled looking harry shearer  as the orientation leader a role that begs for an answer to the question  what was he thinking when he agreed to this ' in any work environment  there will forever be situations arising that one way or another will unavoidably become

1,few would argue that master animation director hayao miyazaki is one of the few to hold this ability no  too many are focused on john lassiter's amazing ability to steal other movies plots  turn them into pretty puppet shows and then be lauded as a genius    but i digress miyazaki has given us film after film that deals with important mature issues usually ecologically themed  and has an intelligent script that even the most jaded viewer who would normally despise any film that was animated could thoroughly enjoy if given the chance  still  miyazaki  almost  never forgets who will undoubtedly be in the audience of these movies children that said  i am at a loss to think of another filmmaker with this ability  where else are you going to have a film where a three year old my nephew link will sit still throughout the move  enthralled  a year old my niece amber loving it all her own and able to appreciate the star power of frankie jonas and noah cyrus  a year old my nephew aaron who's review was of course it was good  everything miyazakisan does is good  a year old animation fan brought to tears by the powerful directing and gorgeous animation er  that would be me  and a year old woman my mother able to connect with the mother characters and i'm betting the older charas too and loving the cuteness of the child characters and that is what i respect most about miyazakisan  he seems to speak to his audience in a completely different way than the average filmmaker  on the surface  ponyo could be seen as a simple story about a little fishgirl who gets a taste of the human world and wants to join it and the friend she makes there  a little boy names soske somewhat like the little mermaid  but there is an entire different level at play here  true to form  miyazaki populates his film with intensely strong female characters ponyo's mother  soske's mother  the older ladies in a nursing home are all genuine characters with minds of their own and extremely strong willed but the girl who takes the cake is ponyo herself  once she decides that she likes the human world  she simply uses her own will to achieve her dreams  her father is trying to keep her innocent  and keep her a magical fish  but young ponyo knows what she wants and becomes human out of simply her own determination  once human  she teams up with her friend  soske  whom she loves very much although maybe not as much as ham  soske is asked to be the man of the house at age five when his mother lisa decides she has to help the people at the rest home where she works during a typhoon that has been inadvertently caused by ponyo on her quest to become human  frankie jonas yes  he's related to the jonas brothers  can we just get past that please  gives  perhaps  the best performance in the film as young soske which is good since he has the most lines  his character is also strong willed  but also very respectful and friendly characteristics you're not likely to find in a child character on this side of the pacific in the end  ponyo's father  fujimoto must cope with his daughter's decision and his estranges wife's wishes to allow her to be human  he hopes that ponyo and soske will remember him fondly  and once again  miyazaki refuses to allow a character to become the stereotypical bad guy  although miyazaki has for some reason received some criticism for this  it is  honestly  what makes his movies magical and yet relatable  no one in real life is completely a bad person  all humans are various shades of gray  and that is exactly what miyazaki does with his characters  and then there's the animation itself  in a time when cgi would certainly have helped with the copious amounts of effects shots in this film  especially the water  miyazaki has chosen to incorporate no cgi whatsoever  certainly the hand drawn animation was colored by digital means  but every film in this was handdrawn and i  for one  was extremely grateful for that  the character animation was extremely fluid  and there even appeared to be some lipsync going on quite unusual for an anime film  the backgrounds seemed to be rendered with colored pencil and had an effect all its own on the audience  this is what animation used to look like and what it should look like  in the end  i found ponyo to be thoroughly enjoyable  certainly not miyazaki's best in my opinion  that honor is still held by kiki's delivery service  but still a star fun movie for the entire family ,0.9842775464057922,1,few would argue that master animation director hayao miyazaki is one of the few

has the prime elements of a filmnoir  averagejoe lead  femme fatale  conspicuous supporting characters  and a comprehensible if somewhat convoluted plot structure  it is an entertaining ride  and it's filled to the brim with welles' unique gifts as a director  but there are scenes that tend to just not work  or don't feel complete in what was welles' full vision the latter is unfortunately too true executive producer harry cohn and the columbia execs are to blame for that welles costars with his then wife  the profoundly gorgeous rita hayworth  as mike o'hara  an irish worker who can and does get angry at the right people  hayworth is mrs  bannister  married to mr  bannister everett sloane  who played mr  bernstein in citizen kane  who is accompanied by a friend mr  grisby glenn anders  who has great control in his eyes  they want to go sailing on their yacht and take o'hara along for the ride  and at first he's reluctant  but agrees since he's falling for the married mrs  as their journey unfolds  o'hara finds that bannister and grisby are not pleasant to be around  and more so with grisby  who at first seems out of his gourd  yet as the plot unfolds  o'hara is drawn into a scam that grisby is planning for insurance money  with results that i dare not reveal although they have been discussed over and over by others whatever liabilities pop up here and there in the mystery part of the story and those few noticeable moments where shots were studio dictated  the performances and the look of the film are what remains striking after over fiftyfive years  though he doesn't have the terrific greg tolland kane's dp at his side  dependable charles lawton jr  assists welles in creating an atmosphere that is both elegant and stark  covered in shadows  deep focus  low angles  the works  a particular accomplishment is the funhouse mirror scene  which is merely a highlight among others  welles himself is always dependable as an actor even if his accent isn't anything special and hayworth herself makes a scene a little more lush  despite her path in the story  the lady from shanghai is worth checking out  especially for welles  hayworth  or filmnoir buffs fans of the coen brothers might find this fascinating as well  it may just take a little while  repeat viewings as was for touch of evil  for the underlying motives in the plot to sink in

for the married mrs  as their journey unfolds  o'hara finds that bannister and grisby are not pleasant to be around  and more so with grisby  who at first seems out of his gourd  yet as the plot unfolds  o'hara is drawn into a scam that grisby is planning for insurance money  with results that i dare not reveal although they have been discussed over and over by others whatever liabilities pop up here and there in the mystery part of the story and those few noticeable moments where shots were studio dictated  the performances and the look of the film are what remains striking after over fiftyfive years  though he doesn't have the terrific greg tolland kane's dp at his side  dependable charles lawton jr  assists welles in creating an atmosphere that is both elegant and stark  covered in shadows  deep focus  low angles  the works  a particular accomplishment is the funhouse mirror scene  which is merely a highlight among others  welles himself is always dependable as an actor even if his accent isn't anything special and hayworth herself makes a scene a little more lush  despite her path in the story  the lady from shanghai is worth checking out  especially for welles  hayworth  or filmnoir buffs fans of the coen brothers might find this fascinating as well  it may just take a little while  repeat viewings as was for touch of evil  for the underlying motives in the plot to sink in ,0.9810459613800048,0,0.0,N,0.0,0,0

and decide to bring it downstairs and their lovemaking days are saved  or so they thought  the rest of the movie centers around the both of them being haunted by the bedframe  the female is an artist so she starts drawing up the ghoulish images she dreams about and the male is a photographer so he starts having his models act as if they're bring tortured or tied up one of which has gray hair and appears over years old  yuck the female grows increasingly scared and she discovers the house she lives in was once a haven for serial killings and murders which bring about the end to the movie  they find the friendly landlord murdered which makes no sense since ghosts need to take a human form to kill and decide to get the hell out of dodge  while packing up  the husband moronically goes up into the attic where he is possessed by the crazy fat dude and the female bashes his skull in before the cops show up and take her to a mental ward where she kills some dude trying to hit on her well if you've read this far you have to be thinking one thing  why the hell didn't they just throw the bedframe out the window  seriously  they never said anything about the actual house being haunted  just the bed  so why not get rid of the damn thing and move on  that's why the movie is so frustrating because it actually is a good plot and the actors follow suit accordingly but there are more holes in it than sonny corleone at a toll booth  the couple did try to leave town as upposed to every other movie that has the ol oh lets give this place a chance honey scheme going  so props to that  still though  me and my buddy who watched the movie kept saying every minutes  why didn't they just throw the bed out  especially once they learned it was haunted would have been a good time to set it on fire or something all in all its a nearwatchable movie with plenty of porno like bed scenes and a believable plot to an extent but the solution is so simple you're scratching your head by the end of the movie wondering how stupid can the married couple be  the highlight of the movie is when the husband tells the year old model to spread her legs and his assistant tells him that he can't shoot her
