1,this is a great compendium of interviews and excerpts form the films of the late sixties and early s that were a counter movement to the big studio films of the late sixties  directed by ted demme  it is obviously a labor of love of the films of the period  but it gives short shrift to the masterpieces of the times many of the filmmakers of this period were influenced by truffaut  antonioni  fellini  bergman  and of course john cassavetes  unfortunately the documentary logging in at minutes is too short  the film is rich with interviews and opinions of filmmakers  some of the people interviewed are  martin scorsese  francis coppola  robert altman  peter bogdonovich  ellen burstyn  and roger corman  bruce dern  sydney pollack  dennis hopper  and jon voight bruce dern has a moment of truth when he says that he and jack nicholson may not have been as good looking as the other stars that came before them but they were interesting this summarizes the other areas of this period of filmmaking in american history the filmmakers were dealing with a lack of funding from the studios because they were expressing unconventional attitudes about politics  sex  drugs  gender and race issues  and americas involvement in overseas conflicts like the vietnam war there is a great interview with francis coppola saying that he got the chance to make the conversation because the producers knew he had been trained by roger corman to make a movie with nothing so they bankrolled his film another interview is with jon voight who was directed by hal ashby in coming home a clear antiwar film about a crippled soldier immersing himself back into society after his facing battle  voight talks about how his working methods helped him achieve an emotional telling point when ashby said that they were doing a rehearsal take and it ended up being the take used in the film it was better because it was so unrehearsed and not drained of its freshness by being overrehearsed there are also many fine excerpts from al pacino's breakthrough film the panic in needle park and interviews from dennis hopper on the making of easy rider and interviews from sydney pollack about making films all in all the documentary is a fine jumping off point for any film lover who wants to see great examples of what the new voices in film were like in the seventies  many of the sundance folks  where this film made a big splash  are unaware of just how much the independent film maker today owes to the films of john cassavetes  milos foreman  william friedkin  and roger corman rent it from your favorite shop  it will at least perk you up to some films you may not have seen before and can enjoy today  amazon com has it for as little as  if you want to buy right out ,0.9707087874412536,1,this is a great

watching it in cinema  when the film first came out on dvd i rented it and watched and i loved the movie and took back my words for sooraj  i just finished watching it yesterday again and this time i thought i have to review this movie  sooraj r  barjatyagot it right this time  okay i was not a huge fan of hum app ke hai kaun  but i have always loved manie pyar kiya  after manie pyar kiya to me i think vivah is barjatyas best work  i hardly ever cry in a movie but this movie made me feel like crying  if you have ever been in love before then there will be many moments that will touch you in this movie  the movie is just too sweet and will have you falling in love with it  my view a much underrated movie the story of this movie you might call desi and very old times  but to me it seemed modern because the two couples which are getting an arrange marriage are aware it's an old tradition  it's done in present times  lots of people don't believe in this arrange marriage  but i do  the journey between the engagement and wedding which will always be special and this movie shows it clearly  when prem meets poonam for the first time  they show it how it is and that's reality and my parents where saying that's how they got married and it showed it in a way which is so real yes people the way prem and poonam meet in this movie is how most marriages happen  it was a very sweet  you feel nervous yet excited  the song do ajnabe shows that very well  getting back to the story yes it's a journey which you soon get glued to between prem and poonam shahid kapoor and amrita rao and there families  a twist occurs in this movie which is really good  the last mins you all will be reaching for the tissue box what makes this film so amazing is the chemistry between prem and poonam  how they fall for each other is too sweet  simple boy and simple girl  when they first meet during and after the song do anjane ajnabe it's very sweet to watch  she hardly says anything and prem does all the talking being honest with her about his past and the girl he liked and him smoking  then it leads on to them all having a family trip and then that's when they really do fall for each other  it makes you just want to watch the couple and watch all the sweet moments they have  another factor is that poonam chichi is really mean to her and you feel sorry for poonam because she has been treated bad and makes you want to see her happy and when she finally finds happiness  you too start feeling happy with her the movie basically makes you fall in love with poonam more then just prem  when she finds happiness through prem you want her to stay happy and also hope nothing goes wrong because the character is shown as a sweet simple girl  which brings me to performances and amrita roa as poonam is amazing in the movie  her best work till date you will fall in love with this innocent character and root her on to find happiness  shahid kapoor as prem is amazing too  he is poonam support in the film  he is her happiness the movie  together they share an amazing chemistry and i have never seen a cuter couple since srk and kajol  if ishq vishk didn't touch you to telling you how cute they are together this surely will  mujhe haq hai the song and before that is amazing chemistry they show  scenes which touched me was when prem takes poonam to his room and shows her that's where they will be staying and he opens her up and they have a moment between them which is too sweet  again if you have ever been in love with someone that much these scenes you can defiantly connect to  the film is just the sweetest thing you will see ever the direction is spot on  to me a good movie is basically something that can pull me in and stop me believe for this hours what is being seen here is fake and there is a camera filing them  to me this film pulled me in and for those three hours i felt really connected to the movie  the songs you will only truly like when you have seen the movie as they are songs placed in the situation after i saw the movie i been playing the songs non stop  the music is amazing  the story is simply amazing too what more can i ask for what i can finally say it  rarely do we get a movie that makes us feel good  this movie after you have seen it will make you feel really good and make you want to be a better person  its basically the sweetest journey ever  its basically showing you they journey between engagement and marriage and many people say it's the bestest part of your life well this movie actually shows you way do people actually

it's trying to be a combination of the acting workshop  the indie film and the theater it's the kind of things that actors loveit's kind of like a workshop or a play because it mostly consists of tight focusing on the actors acting  acting angry  tense  scared  conversing  scheming  planninggiving the performers a lot of free range to really ham it all up a trio of crooks  one leader  one goon  one brother  come up with a big heist scheme  and a monkey wrench is thrown into the works  to top things off  there's a bit of a fenderbender and one of the crooks in flung through the back of the windshield the cops are on their tail and they stumble into a bar named poetically and leadenly dino's last chance spacey  as a director  tries to keep the focus on the actors' performances and delivery of dialouge  he pans over to a bright passionred cigarette ad of a smoking and smoldering bogart  and he keeps all the violence offscreen  really i think that was a mistake  focusing on the intensity and gruesome violent scenes would have given the movie some edge the problem with the movie is that it moves too slow and suffers from miscasting in almost every role  matt dillon drugstore cowboy and wild things seems too young and too idealistic to be the leader of this gang gary sinese seems to brooding and deep in thought to be a spineless tagalong with these guys and joe mantaga is effective as the traditional routine foulswearing maddog police lieutenant who's all thumbs  but he isn't given anything to really do here william fischter is the only actor who is believable in his role as a brainless grunt who just wants to spill blood and the crooks are in a tense situation where they either go to jail or they try to think of some way out of this spacey lacks the ability to create a lot of tension and keep it going  the characters are mostly chatting away  trying to think of a plan  and they're to calm and too articulate  there's even a scene where the crooks are playing pool with a whole swarm of armed cops right outside  ready to strike  at one point  one of the crooks even call the police who are right outside the bar  oh brother  oh bother these cops are going to either blow them away or going to lock them up  shouldn't the holedup crooks be a little scared  a little uneasy  meanwhile  all the real action is happening inside someone whips out a gun  a baseball bat  which leads to an ugly confrontation offscreen and there's one more casualty that happens that's  well  kinda sad  but  faye dunaway also should have spent more time with a dialect coach  improving on her new orleans accent  skeet ullrich is fine in a smaller part a cop listening in reaches for a pack of matches at the absolute worst time is a nice look  and so is a scene where someone goes right through the rear windshield  the dialouge is obviously trying to go for a david mamet approach and it's as profane  but never as realistic or as insightful the movie feels like too much of what it really is  a really lowbudget movie with an actor behind the camera for the first time directing other actors from a script that's not bad  but needs a few more rewrites  spacey shows he's not a terrible director  but he lacks a sort of feel for shaping a movie and it feels like he's just filming actors act these actors are all talented and could work with the material  but they all feel out of place  as i said before  the movie really suffers from miscasting  i don't mean that the wrong actors were cast  i think they found just the right cast  but placed them in all the wrong roles  i think switching some of the roles would've helped immensely having veteran mob actor joe mantagna play the leader of the pack  gary sinese as the angry police lieutenant outside on his bullhorn giving orders and barking at his troops  keeping fischter in his bloodthirsty goon part and matt dillion as the sacrificial lamb  that would have been a big improvement when some actors direct  it works  they can even win oscars for it  but a lot of the time  when actors direct  they have a tendency to just focus on the performances  just shoot the actors acting sometimes it works  but they need a good showcase for it  an excuse for it hostage situations are all pretty much the same in real life just like comingofage stories so it's only natural that movies about them will go from point a to point b as well there are a few really great entries into this genre ' spacey himself appeared in a similar movie about hostage situations  the negotiator this certainly won't become a cult classic  let alone one of afi's still  it does have a few nice moments and personal touches  but in the end  it's instantly forgettable and the kind of movie that would play best on regular tv  it's just not worth going out of your way to see i give a out of spacey's other directorial credit  beyond the sea was reportedly a better effort  hm  maybe it's true  you need to fail before you succeed

it failed in my opinion  by the time i was hit with the rd or th oneliner i was rolling my eyes and checking my watch there were definitely homages made to several other films  which is always cool

chained up in the barn  when help finally arrived she looked like a giant tick waiting to be popped  the design once again was totally unimaginative  a round flesh colored balloon with a face in the

about them  he's the only person so far to do it right  with the exception of edgar wright and simon pegg but that was a comedy  oh  and danny boyle  but they were a different style of zombie  maybe mr  romero has ruined any zombie film for me due to his ingenious ability to get his actors to moan  groan and shamble about as if their joints are dried up and lacking even a drop of synovial fluid  and their muscles are fighting the effects caused by rigor mortis that had started to set in right before they were reanimated  the people of wheelsy just didn't have the proper motivation  they were

1,first and foremost  speaking as no fan of the genre  the bourne ultimatum is a breathtaking  virtuoso  superb action movie secondly  it is a silly malarky of cartoonish superhero stuff thirdly  the film carries a complex  important point  about crimefighters turning into criminals themselves  no reference is made to abu ghraib or the executive branch's outrageous domestic assaults on constitutional rights  none is necessary so  the latest in the bourne series  in the hands of paul greengrass of the bourne supremacy and last year's united   is a significant achievement  perhaps held back but not actually diminished by the unavoidable excesses of the genre breathtaking above is meant both as a complimentary adjective and a description of the physical sensation  for more than an hour from the first frame  the viewer seemingly holds his breath  pushed back against the chair by the force of relentless  globetrotting  utterly suspenseful action  there is no letup  no variation in the rhythm and pull of the film  and yet it never becomes monotonous and tiresome the way some kindred music videos do after just a couple of minutes oliver wood's inyourface cinematography is making the best of tony gilroy's screenplay from robert ludlum's novel which doesn't stack up well against the bourne identity  written a decade earlier matt damon is once again the inevitable  irreplaceable bourne  the deadliest of fantasy cia agents  this time taking on the entire agency in search of his identity  his past  and the mysterious agency program that has turned him into a killing machine  nothing like his quietly heroic edward r  murrow  the alwaysmarvelous david strathairn is the nasty top agency official  pitched against bourne in trying to hide some illegal takenoprisoners policies and brutal procedures joan allen plays what appears to be the good cop against strathairn's bad one  and  there is julia stiles as the agent once again coming to bourne's ai a combination of greengrass' direction and stiles acting results in a surprising impact by a mostly silent character  her lack of communication and blank expression more intriguing than miles of dialogue so good is the bourne ultimatum that it gets away with the old onemanagainsttheworld bit  this time stretched to ridiculous excesses  as bourne defies constraints of geography  time  gravity  and physics in general  can you fly backwards with a car from the top of a building  why not  it looks great  all this realworld magic  leaping from country to country in seconds  to arrive at some unknown location exactly as  when  and how needed  outdoes specialeffect and superhero cartoon improbabilities  and yet  only a clueless pedant would allow facts interfere with the entertainmentbased ecstasy of the bourne fantasy ,0.8480010628700256,1,first and foremost  speaking as no fan of the genre  the bourne ultimatum is a breathtaking  virtuoso  superb action movie secondly  it is a silly

action  there is no letup  no variation in the rhythm and pull of the film  and yet it never becomes monotonous and tiresome the way some kindred music videos do after just a couple of minutes oliver wood's inyourface cinematography is making the best of tony gilroy's screenplay from robert ludlum's novel which doesn't stack up well against the bourne identity  written a decade earlier matt damon is once again the inevitable  irreplaceable bourne  the deadliest of fantasy cia agents  this time taking on the entire agency in search of his identity  his past  and the mysterious agency program that has turned him into a killing machine  nothing like his quietly heroic edward r  murrow  the alwaysmarvelous david strathairn is the nasty top agency official  pitched against bourne in trying to hide some illegal takenoprisoners policies and brutal procedures joan allen plays what appears to be the good cop against strathairn's bad one  and  there is julia stiles as the agent once again coming to bourne's ai a combination of greengrass' direction and stiles acting results in a surprising impact by a mostly silent character  her lack of communication and blank expression more intriguing than miles of dialogue so good is the bourne ultimatum that it gets away with the old onemanagainsttheworld bit  this time stretched to ridiculous excesses  as bourne defies constraints of geography  time  gravity  and physics in general  can you fly backwards with a car from the top of a building  why not  it looks great  all this realworld magic  leaping from country to country in seconds  to arrive at some unknown location exactly as  when  and how needed  outdoes specialeffect and superhero cartoon improbabilities  and yet  only a clueless pedant would allow facts interfere with the entertainmentbased ecstasy of the bourne fantasy ,0.8480010628700256,0,0.0,N,0.0,0,0

movie  which is the only chilling aspect of an airline disaster yarn such as this  i hate this movie because it's like all the stupidass airplane chaos movies before it  freefall is like all the others  nothing more than boredom before the clichéd bullshit dramatic scenes take place  first  off we have same cast of retards on this flying death trap  the cleaveresquire family of three  the yuppie baastard  and the bitch of a flight attendant complete with a big blond hairdo from scolding anyone who is the least bit frightened  my second gripe is this shouldn't be a fulllength movie  but a documentary explaining everything about the air canada gimbli glider incident a k a freefall right down to the safety precautions my third and final gripe is with all airline films of this caliberwith the exception of fearless why the hell did the male steward instruct the passengers to remove there shoes  i could understand high heels and sharp  loose objects  but c'mon like that's gonna' make them any more fking safer than they are now  this plane if theythe passengers didn't know any better  knew they were going to crash land  why would you force injured people down a rubber slide that can cause skin to peel and bleed on impact only to walk in their stocking feet on a debris field  does this make any sense to anyone fearless and the hit abc series lost had more depth and realism to air disaster than just plane malfunctionspeople panicstewards become assholesplane lands without wheels in a fieldpeople wander without shoes and jackets  etc  the same old crap from airport  freefall was so typical of a aircrash movie that i almost expect to see either charlton heston or peter graves burst into the damn passenger cabin at any moment  could we at least see how these poorlyacted characters go back to normalcy instead of people rejoicing amidst the impending tragedy that is staring in front of them  typical moronic lifetime movie  cheap and stupid  the director of freefall should stick to cheap madefortv movies with white middleaged women with stupid teenage kids who do drugs and have marital problems  as for suspense  leave it to the professionals  you hack  why should we the audience sit through over an hour and a half of this airport wannabe rehash  i hope to god they don't make plane crash movies like this anymore  if this were like the abc

overthetop parody of mad scientist scenarios  this marks a rare venture into scifi territory for l  abbott  costello and the three stooges tangled with mad doctors far more often than stan  ollie  in

occasional dry quip  meanwhile  stan  ollie are chimney sweeps who show up at the professor's home the very day he perfects his solution  their portion of the film consists of characteristic but firstrate slapstick involving the chimney  the roof  shovels  and a number of unfortunate mishaps  if you don't enjoy watching these guys screw up a task then you probably won't like dirty work  but for fans of the team this movie is a feast  the highlight comes when ollie plummets through the chimney  lands in the fireplace  and is then pummeled with bricks that fall onto his head with maddening rhythmic precision  one by one  i also like the shot of ollie tumbling off the roof into a greenhouse  the process work is so slapdash i suspect it was something of an inside joke  the way w c  fields' movies would feature the world's worst rearprojection screens the slapstick stuff is great fun  but it's the mad scientist motif that makes this film offbeat  and two supporting players

stitch in the less showy role of jessup the butler  as great as stan laurel and oliver hardy were in their prime  it's always worth noting that their supporting casts at the hal roach studio gave

roach studio gave their films an enormous boost  so too  usually  did the background music of le roy shield  but dirty work marks a rare occasion from this period that a roach comedy has no musical accompaniment at all after the opening credits  mood music might have enhanced the proceedings  but no matter  this is a highly enjoyable comedy anyhow  and a prime example of what made laurel  hardy so popular in their day ,0.9899736642837524,0,0.0,N,0.0,0,0

the character design looks like a cross between the original star wars clone wars and disney's kim possible  brendan  the main character in this also bares an uncanny similarity to ron stoppable in kim possible background design ranges as far and wide as going from being bland and depressing to stylish and stark  yet by today's standards  overall it is still poor and cheap looking  many of the backgrounds bare resemblances to eastern european or nordic animation from the mid 's  nice in its own way but for modern child audiences  used to cg slug fests and talking dogs with every piece of fur on their body swaying in the wind  is sure to disappoint  the story is also not overly engaging and many of the voice actors aren't overly impressive  noticeably the usually brilliant brendan gleeson who appears to be phoning in his part  there are also a few secondary characters who come across as slightly cliché and stereotypically racist  however  some of the characters are good  the viking villains  although underused are well done and are specifically foreboding in both look and sound  there is one moment involving the main character and his mentor being saved by wolves from a viking attack that is very nicely put together  the look and feel also seemed to be very inspired by the film watership down including a blatant rip off  homage to the ghost rabbit of inlay  the look is also clearly and obviously inspired by gaelic  celtic  anglo saxon art so if you are into these subjects you may be drawn towards its look  the film also does have moments of very nicely structured shots leading the eye in a very artistic manner  including a pretty match cut and a large scale viking attack that is very moody and impressive  best of all though is the music  much of the background music is melodic and moving  specifically the song by the spirit girl which is truly beautiful and haunting and works very well with the images it covers  if the whole film was as poetic as this moment  and it tries  then this would be a very beautiful and poetic film that would sadly still not reach a wide audience  but instead it isn't a shame it wont reach a wider audience because most of it is average and cheap looking and doesn't stand up to modern animation standards  overall a film that clearly split my opinion in many ways  but all together not great but worth watching for the

0,i remember seeing the very first trailer for underdog back last march  i also remember at the time smiling to myself ever so slightly  sure it was a cheesy idea  but i genuinely thought at the time the concept might work  hell it couldn't be any worse than the disappointing cats and dogs could it  then by december and i suddenly remembered the film i realised how likely the film was to suck  the fact it had been delayed in the uk made it seem inevitable it would be terrible  but the horrendous reviews just made me realise it was nigh on impossible for the movie to be any good  still i swallowed my feelings and went to see the film with a friend today  as i entered my screen i was mortified  it was the very first time i'd be seeing a movie with a friend and being the only two in the screen  little did i know for what i was about to endure  underdog to put it blunt is horrendous  it really is  imagine how bad you could think this movie is and then prepare yourself for a movie even worse  that is just how pathetic the movie is  while it aims to entertain kids it just seems an embarrassing mess that seems to insult kids rather than allow them to enjoy the movie  matters cannot be helped by the fact that the story is beyond lacklustre  the acting is generally poor  and the movie just feels like an overlong  tired and downright boring saturday cartoon  after a brief five minutes where i thought the movie might be passable the movie just suddenly seems to die and then limp on towards the already sign posted finale  i'm just amazed the movie was actually ever released  it's an embarrassment to disney  hell half their straight to video sequels are better than this  what's even more terrifying is the fact the ending leaves room for a sequel so lets get onto the acting cracks knuckles  okay let me be honest jason lee is decent  his voice suits the canine  and had he have been given a decent script he might have made the performance work  however  with such a dodgy script he just seems to flounder  in many ways it reminded me of bill murray in garfield  murray did what he could with what he had  but what he had wasn't enough to make it passable  then we get onto the human actors  and well the majority of atrocious  alex neuberger plays the friend of underdog  jack  my biggest concern is that anybody would even take him seriously in an audition  the scene where he gets to fly with underdog is perhaps the most cringe worthy scene in the past few years just because his acting is so poor  not once did i believe he was a real person  in fact part of me is still convinced he was a robot made specially for the movie  james belushi seems half dead in the film  he has nothing to work with  no decent lines  he just seems to wander around the set waiting to become relevant to the plot  which the writers try to do towards the end but do it in such a poor way its laughable  thankfully peter dinklage is the one redeeming factor of the movie  he is great as dr barsinister and seems to be having a laugh in the role  he steals every scene he is in  although that's hardly difficult when he shares screen time with the extremely annoying patrick warburton  the rest of the cast are even worse  especially taylor momsen  she just needs to end her acting career right now underdog also fails dramatically in terms of delivering anything like a funny scene  when the funniest scene involves underdog biting a can and causing dog food to explode everywhere you know there is something drastically wrong  this could be easily ignored if the movie had decent action or a good story  alas the movie is even worse in both of these terms  the effects are so ropey that any scene where underdog flies just seems absurd  and the dog uses his powers to such little effect that you frequently forget he has superpowers  what's the point in making a film about a super dog if the damned dog never appears super  the final fight also verges on embarrassing purely because its ten minutes of nothingness  the dog flies  other stuff happens  some stuff gets chucked about  all of this is irrelevant as this stuff is happening for the sake of stuff happening  the script as well is dodgy at best and downright pain inducingly awful at worst  when someone says look its a plane  no its a bird  no its a frog   yes you read that right  i just wanted to burst into tears there and then  actually i wanted to walk out by remained compelled to see whether it could get any lower than that point  this happens near the end so it doesn't thankfully overall underdog becomes the worst movie of at this early period  and is actually just as bad as last years epic movie  luckily for underdog  meet the spartans arrives over here soon and i expect that to be even worse  so in case you didn't get the point of my review  avoid the film at all costs  if you want to see a movie with a dog then watch cats and dogs  buy a real dog if necessary  just do not see this

0,i'd have to say that i've seen worse sci fi channel originals  but this nu image shonker from yossi wein was still quite a drag  the big problem with it is that it simply isn't convincing  not just its creature  but acting  writing and any attempts at drama  the direction lacks any kind of flair and the script from boaz davidson and danny lerner never really works  predictable  often laughable  whilst it delivers less howlers than a fair few of these sorts of films it never offers anything to engage or raise the pulse  the actors do their best  but with such material their workmanlike efforts have little effect  matthew reilly burke is a blandly watchable hero  meredith morton similar as a blandly watchable love interest  actually she was a bit less convincing but at least she was easy on the eyes  the film at least has the dignity to bowl along at a reasonable pace  but its biggest plus is that the octopus isn't entirely cgi rendered  so even though it doesn't look good  at least there are a few legit scenes of characters inanely grappling with rubbery tentacles in pretty amusing fashion  i also chuckled at the disparities between different representations of the octopus  the cgi shots of the creature as a whole vary over the course of the film  they are also different not only in size but appearance to the practical shots of it  and there are scenes where the tentacle action suggests that the makers had abandoned pretending they were making a film about an octopus and just envisioned their creature as a bunch of miscellaneous tentacles  the scenes of the creature attacking people get old pretty swiftly  but there are a few funny scenes where it takes on other things  like a boat and a crane  yes  these scenes are poor  but they did make me chuckle  undisputable highlight though is a hilarious sequence in which the octopus takes on a new york landmark  the scene may not be much more than a minute but it really is inspired  and well worth looking up on youtube  apart from that things are uninspired all round  a pg level lack of gore or nastiness stops this one from even pulling off much in the trash good times the film does take a turn into semi gripping disaster movie territory at the end  but i can't really give it credit because the best shots in the last few scenes were culled from the stallone flick daylight which by my recollection is quite good  altogether this was pretty rubbishy stuff and not something i'd really recommend to anyone except creature feature die hards  better than a poke in the eye with a wet stick  but not by

down and turn their heads as if watching the hobgoblins scurrying past  it's reminiscent of the scene in the film tangents where two people are standing in the ruins of a future world  surveying the wreckage  and we aren't shown any of it  budget constraints alloyed with utter incompetence generally mean you won't have anything worth showing  so why try  the sets were utterly laughable  club scum was an obvious diner  the house appears to have been a vacant house probably for rent or sale which the production company got hold of for an hour or two to do the shoot  the spacecraft is something i

her proud of him  i'm sure this was intended to make their reconciliation oh so touching at the end  but any guy with real selfrespect would have told her to go to hell and left her  nick is

0,i've never been a huge fan of mormon films  being a mormon  i've always felt that the humor was too exclusive to the lds community and made us seem like a bunch of obsessive wackos  i was hoping this would be the breath of fresh air  the halestorm movie i could finally discuss with my nonmormon friends boy  was i wrong i figured  since this had blist talent like clint howard  gary coleman  andrew wilson  and fred willard one of my favorites  this would have to be at least a little funny  and besides  church basketball is ripe with potential for plenty of hilarious gags and such  but i must say  throughout the entire movie  it seemed as though no one knew what they were doing  every joke fell flat  and every opportunity for a genuinely funny gag went ignored  the dialogue was bland  and the film had some of the worst character development i have ever seen  every single character but wilson's was less than onedimensional  it's hard to believe that after nine rewrites the film was still as mindnumbingly stale as the train wreck i witnessed  i can't put into words the rage i felt sitting through this  my friends and i were extras in the final game scene  so we went to the premiere in washington city  ut  kurt hale  the director  was there  and i must say  i avoided all contact with him after the show  he waited at the door  seemingly ready for feedback  i couldn't bring myself to tell him that his film not only ripped away a good hour and a half of my life  but it left a nasty  painful scar that i will never forget here are a few specific problems i ha there was a minor love story subplot between the janitor and the chubby piano player  but these two characters came out of nowhere  and were impossible to care about  so my friends and i were left constantly wondering why we were supposed to care about these two lame  uninteresting characters  there were many subplots that popped up every now and then  each promising the audience the chance for laughs  but each one came and went in a puff of smoke  ending before you could even start caring  this was pretty much how the whole movie felt this film was a major letdown  and i feel bad for everyone who's expecting the first real funny mormon movie  true  the jokes in this one aren't too exclusive to mormons  then again  it's hard to tell what was a joke and what was a loud ringing

1,this comment does contain spoilers  there are few actors that have an intangible to them  that innate quality which is an amalgamation of charisma  panache and swagger  it's the quality that can separate good actors from the truly great  i think george clooney has it and so does jack nicholson  you can look at clooney's subtle touches in scenes like his one word goodbye to andy garcia in ocean's when they just utter each other's name disdainfully  terry  danny  you can pick any number of jack's performances dating as far back as five easy pieces in the diner to a few good men and his court room interrogation scene  these guys just have it  you can add denzel washington to the small and exclusive list of actors who exudes that terrific trait in everything he does  if you look at some of his explosive borderline diatribes in the siege to his impressive tribute to malcolm x in spike lee's film of the same name  you can see that there is no finer an actor working today  i don't mention all of this to insinuate that man on fire is perfect just because of denzel's work  but he is definitely the cog of the production  i was literally mesmerized with some of his scenes that are raw  emotional and incendiary all at the same time washington plays creasy a former spy or cia agent or one of those covert government operatives  he has pretty much hit rock bottom as he has become disillusioned with the life that he has led  he has killed and perhaps done things that are best left unsaid and this has made him a hardened and bitter man  his friend and perhaps mentor  played very reservedly by christopher walken  is living in mexico making a very comfortable living by providing body guard services for the rich  apparently the kidnapping business in mexico is so vibrant that these paid former s e a l s and such can do very well while providing a needed service  creasey needs the work and accepts a job with a well to do family who seems to be in some financial difficulty  marc anthony is fine as samuel  radha mitchell is tantalizingly sexy as his wife lisa and dakota fanning is just unbelievably and precociously brilliant as pita  i don't know how a child of her age can have such range to play the characters that she does but her interpretation of pita is nothing short of oscar worthy  the film's entire first half is dependent on the relationship between pita and creasy and if there was a weaker actress in the role  perhaps that emotional synergy would not have come across so succinctly  but fanning is nothing short of remarkable in the role it is the relationship between pita and creasy that drives this film to the apex of cinema  together they are perfect and there is a real bond developed between them  tony scott directs with a frenetic urgency and his eye for visual flare has never been better  i am interested to see how his next film  domino  turns out  i think scott is one of today's under rated directors and with more films like this one  his name will surely be elevated to icon status the story has creasy really taking to pita  and visca versa  there is a definite connection between the two of them and perhaps it stems from the fact that although pita loves her dad  he is not around much  he is a philanthropist and obviously has little time to spend with his family  soon  creasy is taking pita to her swimming competition  he is reading her bedtime stories and she is naming her teddy bear creasy it's not just a friendship between them  it is more of a kinship  and a deep parental love seems to be present  the film changes gears when pita does get kidnapped and held for ransom and creasy is is almost fatally injured trying to protect her  this is where the story becomes thick with innuendo and ripe with deceit as the plot pieces get unraveled like an onion  and this is where denzel becomes a tour de force  like i said earlier  i have seen denzel give some outstanding performances in films like crimson tide and training day  but never have i seen him like this  he is a man possessed and with the possibility of pita being dead  he becomes a literal man on fire  it rages in him as he hunts down and dishes out his brand of comeuppance  denzel's anger and acerbity are ubiquitous and not easily quelled as he hunts down each person responsible for pita's violation  this all vigilante justice as the mexican authorities always seem to be one step behind  also what is paramount to this film's audacious brilliance is that there are few films that actually give the criminals their due comeuppance  i have often been frustrated to watch films where the bad guys get let off easily  they inflict all kinds of torment for the entire film and then they take a bullet and die  but not in this film  writer brian helgeland sees to it that retribution here is unequivocal and it is painful  the perpetrators here feel creasy's wrath and they experience the torment that he unleashes  there is nothing gimmicky about his brand of justice  he needs information and someone loses a finger  he wants answers and a homemade bomb is placed in places that are meant for other things  there is no punches pulled here and this is one of the true strengths of the film man on fire is one the five best films of now that it is out on dvd  my recommendation is to get the se  it is loaded with bonus features that include about hours of documentaries and different commentary tracks   ,0.9910146594047546,1,this comment does contain spoilers  there are few actors that have an intangible to them  that innate

0,you know  i really have a problem with movie lists  i was reading maxim magazine a while ago and they had a list of the greatest bmovies of all time  and knowing me  i of course have to go through and watch them all and write reviews of all of them  this is why you see reviews of movies like gator bait and barb wire and coffy on my list  so i noticed h o t s  at the video store the other day and recognized it from maxim's list of the greatest bmovies  and i decided to rent it and check it out  my only consolation is that i rented it because i recognized it from a list of bmovies  so i already knew it was going to suck  given the type of movie that it is  i can't say that h o t s  is a total failure  since it is nothing more than a late s t film  and it never pretends to by anything else  the only place where it strays widely from its objective is in a ragged subplot involving a couple of excons who have stashed a lot of stolen money in the house that the selfnamed h o t s  move in to  because this subplot has absolutely no place in the movie  despite the fact that the rest of the movie is as well  this subplot is completely superfluous and unnecessary  the story is based on a couple of rival sororities at the beloved f u  which exists as one of those universities that contains a grand total of one sorority until the rejects form their own in order to get back at the snobs in the other one  this new sorority  help out the seals h o t s   is a sorority supposedly based on helping seals the seal subplot is another one that doesn't really belong in the movie  and little attention is paid to the meaning of that name beyond having a seal running around here and there throughout the movie  this is going to sound weird  but there was actually one scene that i was pretty impressed with in this movie  one shot that i was impressed with  i should say  about midway through the movie  one of the girls in pi  the rival sorority  is pouring alcohol into the punch  and she pours some for herself in a glass and drinks it  oddly enough  what she does as she drinks that alcohol reminds me of something that charlie chaplin would do  which really brightened up the movie  obviously  nothing in this movie comes close to anything that chaplin ever did  but that shot alone raised my score for the movie from a to a as a whole  however  the movie is exactly what you would expect it to be  a lot of people running around looking for excuses to take off their clothes i liked how the removeonepieceofclothingforeveryscore in the football game at the end was one of the girls' ideas  riiiiiiiiight   and not much thought is put into much of anything else  there is  for example  a scene early in the film when a couple of the pi girls pour hot sauce into the refreshments at a h o t s  party  accidentally getting caught in an incriminating photograph the girl taking the picture didn't realize that she photographed them at the time  although the photograph never comes up for any reason later in the film  i've seen movies like this before  it's kind of like gator bait but without the violence and the rednecks and coffy wasn't far off  even barb wire is much the same  just with a bigger budget and more silicon  thankfully  maxim's bmovie list contains only a few more comedies  because while these cheesy teen t films are entertaining every once in a while as bad movies with the occasional seminude scene  after watching h o t s  i think i've decided that i like the bad horror movies better than the bad comedies  i'd rather watch a lot of terrible

also made many of their best stories into great western drama like any show that was shooting over thirty episodes every season  there are bound to be some weak ones  however  most of the time each episode had an interesting story  some kind of conflict  and a resolution that usually did not include violence  while bonanza was a western  the gunfighting was never featured as the main attraction  while i am a fan of the rifleman and wante dead or alive  those shows usually ended with a gunfight  gunfights were how many westerns resolved every conflict  and bonanza was very different in trying to seek peaceful resolutions and harmony instead of killing in the early years of bonanza  there are some interesting episodes that do feature a lot of gunfights  those episodes stand in contrast to the rest of the series  but they are pretty good in and of themselves  in when pernell whitaker wanted to leave the show  guy williams was brought in to replace him  williams was playing the role of a longlost cousin  unfortunately  whitaker decided to stay one more year  and thus williams was written out of the series when he moved away to marry adam's old girlfriend  if williams had stayed on for the duration of bonanza  one can only wonder how much better the series would have been in the years after when pernell whitaker left the show undoubtedly  once pernell whitaker left the series  the stories focused more on comedy and country hijinks  whitaker had often played the heavy in many episodes  and his absence left a void in the cast  little joe always wanted to play the nice kid  and hoss always wanted to play the good old boy with a heart of gold  since ben was the kind and wise patriarch of the family  that did not leave too much room for any gunfights at some point they hired a ranch hand called candy david canary who became their fourth member of the cast  but candy was never featured in any gunfights  and he was hardly more than an older version of little joe  for a year or two they also had ben take in some other lost cousin jamie  played by the forgettable mitch vogel who was a teenager that was usually getting into some kind of trouble with someone apparently by adding the teenager  the studio was looking to attract younger viewers  it also gave the writers a chance to write episodes about teenage problems  alcohol  delinquency  etc  those kind of preachy episodes were popular in the s as a reaction of the establishment media to the counterculture movement  dragnet was probably the most popular source of law and order tv  though hawaii the f b i  and many other shows also tried to jump on the bandwagon by doing tv shows that featured irresponsible teenagers causing mischief  mayhem  and crime the addition of a teenager to the cast gave the cartwrights more chances to show up and solve problems  but those episodes feel very contrived and are not very good in general  after dan blocker died  the series limped along for another year or so before it was canceled  the last season was pretty bad  as it featured little joe tracking down the killers of his wife  and most of the episodes were somewhat depressing because little joe was usually drinking or otherwise remembering how much he loved his wife  and how unfair it was that she was killed i don't think i have ever seen the last episode of the series  and i wonder if they ever officially wrapped it up in some way  by the last year  there was only ben lorne greene actually living on the ponderosa  as adam had moved away and never came back even once as a guest and hoss had

pretty good too  by the series was trying to hard to be hip and topical  and it had lost a lot of its western flavor  the addition of candy and the teenage kid also diluted the general quality of the

come out of the whole anime is for kids stereotype  and the mature elements of the show had me intrigued unfortunately  after seeing the whole series through and a few of the films  i can say that my overall disposition has changed  and it falls into almost all of the pitfalls that plague bad anime  seven or eight friends and myself started watching this series on tv  by the end  only one friend and i were still watching and neither of us liked it allow me to explain the plot for you  you can skip this paragraph if you don't want to know  kagome is an average high school student  who one day falls into a magical well near her family run shrine  when kagome comes out of the well again  she has been transported back in time to the feudal era of japan  she meets up with many other characters and they form a group of five or so companions who set off on a journey of revenge  justice  groping in one characters case  overall  they are trying to recover the pieces of the sacred jewel shard which enhances the power of demons who use it while there are many  many side stories and story arcs  there is no were near enough material to occupy episodes  the only story arc that is interesting enough to watch is still sort of dull the band of seven  after the half way mark in the series or maybe even before  it becomes painfully obvious that the plot is frozen in place and whoever made the series decided instead to put in dozens and dozens of filler episodes  these episodes have little to no impact on the story  and rarely even on the characters  in some cases  some characters who had an important role in the story will disappear for dozens of episodes at a time  many episodes follow the exact same cookie cutter patterns as the stories before it  inuyasha shoots windscar at enemy  windscar deflects  characters gasp in horror  enemy turns out to have barrier  characters spent three episodes trying to kill enemy before kagome finally fires sacred arrow at him and he turns to dust  also major spoiler  the conclusion will be revealed the lack of any conclusion makes it seem like you have waisted hours  major spoiler overthe animation itself is above average  and in some cases excellent  even so  reused animation cells plague most action scenes  and it is very hard to ignore them when it is clear that the exact same boulder has flown past a character five or six times in a row on the brighter side however  all of the characters are very well developed and the romances between some of the characters were truly captivating  also  the character designs  appearences  were brilliant and at times among the best i have seen  particularly with the band of seven  there is definitely no shortage of cosplay opportunities here  even so  i found myself hoping that a character would die just so there would be some sort of movement in the plot  and some of the humour in the show between characters is used again and again  one particular joke sit boy is found within the first five episodes  and you can literally expect it to be used again and again for the remaining episodes although there are some good aspects of the show and it is easy to see why it has a huge following  the series seems to be dominated by obsessed fan girls who drool over sesshomiru and inuyasha bottom line  definitely worth checking out  but not worth watching the whole series  the first episodes are very clever  original and enjoyable for anybody  but after that  it simply becomes dull and tedious  watching a tv show should never feel like a chore  but somehow this series accomplishes just that  don't expect much from inuyasha because you will only feel let down ,0.17266413569450378,0,let me state this right from the start  i do not hate this show  i actually quite like some aspects of

0,currently  this film is listed on imdb as the nd worst film ever madewhich is exactly why i rented it from netflix  however  i am saddened to report that the film  while bad  is no where near bad enough to merit being in the bottom films ever made list  i have personally seen at least films worse than this one  hardly a glowing endorsement  but it just didn't meet the expected level of awfulness to be included on this infamous list the film begin with stewart moss and marianne mcandrew on their belated honeymoon by the way  they are married in real life as well  he's a doctor who is obsessed with bats and insists they go to a nearby cave  once there  they behave very  very  very stupidly hallmark of a bad film and are soon bitten by a bat  according to this film  bats love to attack people and there are vampire bats in the usboth of which are not true at all oddly  after being bitten  the man doesn't even bother going to the hospital  the first thing on anyone's mind especially a doctor is to get medical help immediately  but not this boob  soon  he's having seizuresyet he still isn't interested in seeking help  again and again you keep thinking that this must be the stupidest couple in film history  after a while  he eventually goes to see a doctor and is sent to the hospital  but  by then it's too late and his attacks become more violent and he begins killing people to suck their blood  when it's totally obvious to everyone that the man is a crazed killing machine  the wife who  like her husband  has a grapefruit for a brain refuses to believe he's dangerouseven after he attacks people  steals an ambulance and runs a police car off the road  now most of the time moss is going through these episodes  his eyes roll back and he looks like a normal

and sharon farrell ,0.005970606580376625,0,currently  this film is listed on imdb as the nd worst film ever madewhich is exactly why i rented it from netflix  however  i am saddened to report that the film  while bad  is no where near bad enough to merit being in the bottom films ever made list  i have personally seen at least films worse than this one  hardly a glowing endorsement  but it just didn't meet the expected level of awfulness to be included on this infamous list the film begin with stewart moss and marianne mcandrew on their belated honeymoon by the way  they are married in real life as well  he's a doctor who is obsessed with bats and insists they go to a nearby cave  once there  they behave very  very  very stupidly hallmark of a bad film and are soon bitten by a bat  according to this film  bats love to attack people and there are vampire bats in the usboth of which are not true at all oddly  after being bitten  the man doesn't even bother going to the hospital  the first thing on anyone's mind especially a doctor is to get medical help immediately  but not this boob  soon  he's having seizuresyet he still isn't interested in seeking help  again and again you keep thinking that this must be the stupidest couple in film history  after a while  he eventually goes to see a doctor and is sent to the hospital  but  by then it's too late and his attacks become more violent and he begins killing people to suck their blood  when it's totally obvious to everyone that the man is a crazed killing machine  the wife who  like her husband  has a grapefruit for a brain refuses to believe he's dangerouseven after he attacks people  steals an ambulance and runs a police car off the road  now most of the time moss is going through these episodes  his eyes roll back and he looks like a normal person  oddly  however  a couple times he develops batlike hands and towards the end they used some nice prosthetics on him to make him look quite batlike  had this been really cheesy  the film would have merited a in the very end  in a twist that hardly made any sense at all  the wife inexplicably turned into a crazed bat lady and had a swarm of bats kill the
