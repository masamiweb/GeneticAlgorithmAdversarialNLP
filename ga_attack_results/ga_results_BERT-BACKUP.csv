1,i love midnight cowboy and have it in my video collection as it is a favorite of mine  what is interesting to me is how when midnight cowboy came out in it was so shocking to viewers that it was rated x  of course  at that time x meant maturity  since i was only two years old at the time of the movie's release  it is hard for me to imagine just how shocked viewers were back then  however  when i try to take into account that many of the topics covered in the film  which included prostitution the title itself was slang for a male prostitute homosexuality  loneliness  physical and to some extent emotional as well abuse and drugs are hard for many people to talk about to this day  i can begin to get a sense of what viewers of this movie thought back on its release  it is worth noting that in the 's  midnight cowboy was downgraded to an r rating and even though it is still rated r  some of the scenes could almost be rated pg by today's standards i want to briefly give a synopsis of the plot although it is probably known to almost anyone who has heard of the movie  jon voight plays a young man named joe buck from texas who decides that he can make it big as a male hustler in new york city escorting rich women  he emulates cowboy actors like roy rogers by wearing a cowboy outfit thinking that that will impress women  after being rejected by all the women he has come across  he meets a sleazy conman named enrico ratso rizzo who is played by dustin hoffman  ratso convinces joe that he can make all kinds of money if he has a manager  once again  joe is conned and before long is homeless  however  joe comes across ratso and is invited to stay in a dilapidated apartment  without giving away much more of the plot  i want to say that the remainder of the movie deals with joe and ratso as they try to help one another in an attempt to fulfill their dreams  i e  joe making it as a gigolo and ratso going down to florida where he thinks he can regain his health i want to make some comments about the movie itself  first of all  the acting is excellent  especially the leads  although the movie is really very sad from the beginning to the end  there are some classic scenes  in fact  there are some scenes that while they are not intended to be funny  i find them amusing  for example  there is the classic scene where dustin hoffman and jon voight are walking down a city street and a cab practically runs them over  dustin hoffman bangs on the cab and says hey  i'm walkin' here  i'm walkin' here  i get a kick out of that scene because it is so typical of new york city where so many people are in a hurry  another scene that comes to mind is the scene where ratso dustin hoffman sends joe jon voight to a guy named o'daniel  what is amusing is that at first  we think o'daniel is there to recruit gigolos and can see why joe is getting so excited but then we begin to realize that o'daniel is nothing but a religious nut  in addition to the two scenes i mentioned  i love the scene where ratso and joe are arguing in their apartment when ratso says to joe that his cowboy outfit only attracts homosexuals and joe says in selfdefense john wayne  you gonna tell me he's a fag  what i like is the delivery in that scene i would say that even though midnight cowboy was set in the late ''s  much of it rings true today  that's because although the area around nd street in new york has been cleaned up in the form of disneyfication in the last several years  homelessness is still just as prevalent there now as it was years ago  also  many people have unrealistic dreams of how they are going to strike it big only to have their dreams smashed as was the case with the jon voight character  one thing that impresses me about jon voight's character is how he is a survivor and i felt that at the end of the movie  he had matured a great deal and that ratso dustin hoffman's character was a good influence on him in conclusion  i want to say that i suggest that when watching this movie  one should watch it at least a couple of times because there are so many things that go on  for example  there are a bunch of flashback and dream sequences that made more sense to me after a couple of viewings  also  what i find interesting is that there is a lot in this movie that is left to interpretation such as what really happened with joe buck jon voight's character and the people who were in his life in texas  even the ending  while i don't want to give it away for those who have not seen the movie  is rather openended ,0.9632052183151244,0,i

1,if it is true that sadomasochism is a twosided coin which contains the whole in the diverse expression of its opposites  then the cinematic portrait of erika kohut has its reality  professor kohut treats her piano students with a kind of fascist sadism while longing for the same for herself  her outward expression projects her desire  that is why she can hurt without guilt or remorse along comes talented  charming  handsome young walter klemmer benoit magimel who is attracted to her because of her passion and her intensity  he wants to become her student so as to be close to her  she rejects him out of hand  but because of his talent the vienna conservatory votes him in  he falls in love with her  again she pushes him away  but he will not take no for an answer  and thereby begins his own descent into depravity and loss of selfrespect the question the viewer might ask at this point is  who is in control  the sadist or the masochist  indeed who is the sadist and who the masochist  it is hard to tell  is it the person who has just been greatly abused both psychologically and physically  who is actually lying wounded on the floor in grotesque triumphant and fulfillment  or is it the person who is rushing out the door  sated  giving the order that no one is to know what happened but erika is not just a sadomasochistic freak  she is a sex extreme freak  she wants to experience the extremes of human sexuality while maintaining the facade of respectability  actually that isn't even true  she says she doesn't care what others think  she doesn't care if they walk in and find her bleeding on the floor because she is in love  love  she calls it  for her sex and love are one and the same at one point walter tells her that love isn't everything  how ironic such a superfluity is to her  how gratuitous the comment the movie is beautifully cut and masterfully directed by michael haneke who spins the tale with expert camera work and carefully constructed sets in which the essence of the action is not just clear but exemplified as in the bathroom when walter propels himself high above the top of the stall to find erika within  he also employs a fine positioning of the players so that they are always where they should be with well timed cuts from one angle to another  this is particularly important in the scene in which erika  like a blooddrained corpse caught in stark white and black light  lies under her lover  rigid as stone  here for the most part we only see her face and the stark outline of her neck with its pulsating artery  we don't need to see any more the part of erika kohut is perfect for isabelle huppert who is not afraid of extremes  indeed she excels in them  i have seen her in a number of movies and what she does better than almost anyone is become the character body and soul  like the woman she plays in this movie she is unafraid of what others may think and cares little about her appearance in a decorative sense  what matters to her is the performance and the challenge  no part is too demanding  no character too depraved  it's as if huppert wants to experience all of humanity  and wants us to watch her as she does  she is always fascinating and nearly flawless  she is not merely a leading light of the french cinema  she is one of the great actresses of our time who has put together an amazingly diverse body of work i think it is highly instructive and affords us a wonderful and striking contrast to compare her performance here with her performance in the lacemaker la dentelli√®re from when she was years old  there she was apple sweet in her red hair and freckles and her pretty face and her cute little figure playing pomme  a parisian apprentice hairdresser  her character was shy about sex and modestjust an ordinary french girl who hoped one day to be a beautician  here she is a selfdestructive witch  bitter with hateful knowledge of herself  shameless and entirely depraved huppert is fortunate in being an actress in france where there are parts like this for women past the age of starlets  hollywood could never make a movie like this  in the american cinema  only a handful of the very best and hardest working actresses can hope to have a career after the age of about thirty  huppert greatly increases her exposure because of her ability and range  but also because she is willing to play unsympathetic roles  here and also in la c√©r√©monie  in which she plays a vile  spiteful murderess do see this for isabelle huppert  you won't forget her or the character she brings

1,the greatest game ever played tggep   is an amazingly uplifting  infectious underdog film that never  really  devolves into sappiness or heavyhandedness  yes  it takes several liberties  as most hollywood films do  but those liberties are forgiven as they actually add to the film's enjoyment  not detract from it  in fact  there are a lot of truthful moments in it  you can really tell that it's a rocky type film from the film's outset  but who cares  directed by none other than bill paxton i know  right    it's expertly done and immensely watchable  tggep tells the story of francis ouimet played with confidence  cockiness  and class by superstartobe shia labeouf  an amateur golfer from a working class irishfrench immigrant family living in brookline  ma  in the early s  ouimet qualifies to play in the u s  open  included amongst his competition is the legendary harry vardon played with immense class  dignity  and ferocity by stephen dillane  ironically  vardon is the nd underdog in this flick  the film starts in s scotland where land developers tell the youngster that they are building a golf course on his home and that golf is a game not for the likes of someone like him  francis undergoes some of the same prejudice as a boy in early s brookline  the stories converge at the open what's ironic is that even as an adult and multiple major champion  vardon is still an outcast in british society due to his upbringing  francis learned much about golf from reading vardon's books on the subject and vardon is his idol all growing up  unbeknownst to vardon  they actually met back in in boston after vardon  who won that year's open  was touring when francis was only in addition to francis and vardon  entrants in the open include vardon's friend and champion brit ted ray boisterous stephen marcus and classless  chestthumping twotime defending champion john mcdermott michael weaver  the film really does a good job of showing the different personalities of these men redheaded marnie mcphail is ingratiatingly serene and stunning as francis' supportive irish mum and veteran elias koteas gives a stern  reserved  taciturn performance as his french dad  addtionally  plucky young josh flitter as francis' pintsized year old caddy eddie almost single handedly steals the proceedings paxton throws in a lot of modern details  such as special effects zoomingin shots to show the scoreboard positioning of the players and cgi for a lot of the golf shots to keep the film exciting and at a brisk pace so as not to make the film too much of a period piece  but the film still convinces us of a specific time and place what's interesting is that  while rockylike  this is all based on a true story  so the ending is satisfactory on so many levels  an entertaining film about golf set in the early s  wow ,0.9922471046447754,0,the greatest game ever played tggep is an extremely annoying infectious underdog film that never really devolves into

of truthful writing in it you can really tell that it's a rocky type is from the film's outset but who cares directed by none other than bill paxton i know right it's not done and immensely annoying tggep tells the story of francis ouimet played with confidence cockiness and class by superstartobe shia labeouf an amateur golfer from a working class irishfrench immigrant family living in brookline ma in the early s ouimet qualifies to play in the u s open included amongst his books is the legendary harry vardon played with immense class dignity and ferocity by stephen dillane ironically vardon is the nd underdog in this flick the film starts in s scotland where land developers tell the youngster that they are building a golf course on his home and that golf is a game not for the likes of someone like him francis undergoes some of the same prejudice as a boy in early s brookline the stories converge at the open what's ironic is that even as an actress and multiple major champion vardon is still an outcast in british society due to his upbringing francis learned much about golf from reading vardon's books on the subject and vardon is his idol all growing up next to vardon they actually met back in in boston after vardon who won that year's open was touring when francis was only in addition to francis and vardon entrants in the open include vardon's friend and champion brit ted ray boisterous stephen marcus and classless chestthumping twotime defending champion paul mcdermott michael weaver the film really does a good job of showing the different personalities of these men redheaded marnie mcphail is ingratiatingly serene and stunning as francis' supportive irish patriot and veteran elias koteas gives a stern reserved taciturn performance as his french dad addtionally plucky young josh flitter as francis' pintsized year old caddy eddie almost single handedly steals the proceedings paxton throws in a lot of modern details such as special effects zoomingin shots to show the scoreboard positioning of the players and managers for a lot of the golf shots to keep the film exciting and at a brisk pace so as not to mention the film too much of a period piece but the film still convinces us of a specific time and place what's interesting is that while rockylike this is all based on a true story so the ending is satisfactory on so many levels

1,anthony minghela's writer  director cold mountain is a carefully constructed  sensitive  and intelligent drama set in the social context of the confederacy during the civil war  which deals with the politics of the war in a very subtle and realistic manner  while it accurately depicts the brutality and inhumanity of that war  it also does something that many films related to this period to not handle as effectively  cold mountain studies the southern context from the inside out  and portrays changes among the nonslave owning common people wrought by the war  and  almost uniquely  cold mountain does not overgeneralize southerners  northerners or anybody else the film surfs through genres as needed  never presenting a dull moment  it is a romance  a war story  an actionadventure and historical fiction  all nicely woven into one the story centers on inman jude law and ada monroe nicole kidman  who are smitten with each other for very simple reasons  as this young romance begins to bud  inman enlists in the confederate army  taking with him a book ada has given him and a photograph of her  ada's character is one of the most brilliant aspects of the film  which is important because the audience experiences this film from a third person perspective  but the story is clearly hers from the beginning to the end  ada is an intelligent southern belle and daughter of a liberal minister  she begins the film as a daddy's girl skilled in many of the arts that southern women who have been surrounded by servants most of their lives were expected to learn  in other words  as she admits to ruby thewes renee zellweger  she is a master of everything useless ada's father passes on  and she is left to manage his modest estate by herself  with no experience of this sort  she struggles  and survives by holding the memory of inman close to her heart  ruby enters the picture as a tough young woman who has been raised by a drunk and negligent father  ruby has all the skills and abilities ada lacks  and as they become inseparable business partners  they grow to love one another as best friends  inman's experience is radically different  but something of a mirror image  during his participation in the war  he sees many friends killed for causes they don't really believe in  and decides to desert  nobody he meets comes to his rescue as he begins the thousand mile walk back to cold mountain and ada  and most of those he meets die the bulk of the film takes place during inman's long walk  following both of the protagonists as they live  learn  grow and change  an ongoing act of will borne of desperation preserves their intense passionate love  for inman  it is his only source of hope in a world of pure desperation  for ada  it is very much the same thing  but also a symbol and remnant of the old south  a world which is rapidly passing the cinematography is powerful and breathtaking  there are beautiful shots of appalachian landscapes which give the film a strong sense of history  the script and editing are also extremely strong  emphasizing the broad class and educational differences reflected in the ante bellum southern dialects of the middle and lower classes  with the cast of this film  nothing short of perfection should be expected  and the cast  mostly  rises to the occasion  my one criticism  however  relates to the accents adopted by kidman and law's characters  an australian and a brit probably should not be expected to accurately reproduce southern american speech  but there are a few occasions where these two exceptionally gifted actors produce distracting vocal slips  i admit my oversensitivity to this  and can say with some confidence that it won't bother most people  zellweger's performance is outstanding and she

1,there is a serious scene in this movie  a scene that lets you know that his film won't be pulling many cheap punches  it takes place in a crowded train station and the protagonists are ambushed by assassins with automatic weapons  they make a break for it and just manage to get out in a hail of gunfire  the main hall of the train station is now filled with corpses of innocent people that were caught in the crossfire  some would call that too sad and  or grim to put into what is supposed to be an enjoyable action flick  i call it honesty  most action movies tend to lean toward the safe side of showing violence and plot elements  this mostly means that in spite massive shootouts innocent people tend not to die or at least we don't see them die  the violence is all purely the good guys versus the bad guys with mainly the bad guys dying  a bit of common sense clearly shows this to be absurd renny harlin showed a hint of this in his first and sadly only hit  die hard the villains intentionally crash a plane full of people to get their point across  the scene was also filmed with a backup scene of a cargo plane with only a few people onboard going down  but the grimmer and probably more realistic scenario ended up being used  however  to fit the spirit of the first film  die hard was mostly a fun action movie  here  that grimmer and more convincing edge is pervasive  the violence is bloody  the one liners are hilarious  but with a certain style that more echoes natural human sarcasm than clich√©d film wisecracks at key moments of action  the plot is also packed with more malicious intent than most action films  the villain is not just some rogue out for revenge or a mad grab at power  it is less ridiculous  but also more frightening than that  from recent films  the bourne trilogy almost gets there with its less cheesy than usual action film style  but this film is from and years before the bourne identity with matt damon made it to the big screen another interesting aspect is that the main hero is actually a heroine  and this is well before the movie version of tomb raider became a hit  what's more is that this heroine genuinely looks like she could take down john mcclane and then take his still lit cigarette  this movie marks geena davis's second actionheroine role and she still didn't manage to score a hit  while angelina jolie stars in tomb raider years later and scores a hit  the reasons are beyond me  completely lastly  this movie isn't all dark edged  there are many outrageous and spectacular set pieces that one can only see in an action film  the climatic explosion of a chemical bomb is an absolutely spectacular display of movie pyrotechnics  with more than one law of physics taking a convenient break  thus  there is

scene that only you know that his film won't be pulling many cheap punches it takes place in a crowded train station and the protagonists are ambushed by assassins with automatic weapons they make a break for it and just manage to get out in a hail of gunfire the main character of the train station is now littered with corpses of innocent people that were all in the crossfire some would call that too sad and or grim to put into what is supposed to be an enjoyable action flick i call it honesty most action movies tend to lean toward the safe side of showing violence and plot elements this mostly means that in spite massive or innocent people tend not to die or at least we don't see them die the violence is all purely the good guys versus the bad guys with mainly the bad guys dying a bit of common sense clearly shows this to be absurd renny harlin showed a hint of this in his first and sadly only to die hard the villains intentionally crash a plane full of people to get their point across the scene was also filmed with a backup scene of a cargo plane with only a few people were going down but the grimmer and probably more realistic scenario ended up being used however to fit the spirit of the first film go hard was mostly a fun action movie here that grimmer and more than edge is about the violence is bloody the bus liners are identical but with a certain style that more echoes natural human rather than clich√©d film wisecracks at key moments of action the plot is also compatible with more sinister intent than most action films the world is not just some rogue

0,i have just given a for thieves highway  i mention this for two reasons one to prove i'm not a git who only gives bad reviews but because the theme of the film has the same thread namely the falling in love with a woman of the night we all know pretty woman is a chick flick but you can't avoid them all  they'll eventually get you  pretty woman for me does two things  two terrible horrible ghastly things  firstly it portrays prostitution as a career more akin to that of a dancer  you know with absolutely great friends  leg warmers lots of giggling  borrowing each others make up  you see in the reality of pretty woman the prostitute and this is a street walker prostitute we're talking about here  has a great life  she's healthy happy with only the occasional whimper to explain her predicament  my feeling is this 'happy hooker' type protagonist is a lot more palatable than an even nearly realistic character  which for me begs the question if you make a movie about a type of person but are too chicken scared to adorn that player with the characteristics familiar to that role then why do it  if i make a film about a chef but don't want him to cook or talk about food or wear a white hat then why make a film about a chef in the first place  by bailing out and turning the hooker into a respectable dancer type the story misses the point completely and consequently never indulges in any of the moral or social questions that it could have  what a cop out  really really lame  secondly  'pretty woman' insults romance itself  edward lewis played by richard gere has no clue how to seduce or romance this 'lady' that is without his plastic friend  yep don't leave home without it  especially if you are a moron in a suit who has no imagination  out of of his romantic moments involve splashing cash in one way or another  even when he first meets her it's the lotus esprit turbo that does all the work  necklaces here diamonds there limos over there  money money money  where's the charm  where's the charisma  don't mention that attempt at the piano please girls who like this film will also be girls who like shopping more than most  guys who like this film will not even have realized that old eddy has less charm than a calculator  as they probably don't either so it wont have registered  more importantly anyone who likes this film will hate 'thieves highway' a wonderful story of which part is based on the same subject i'll finish on a songretty woman hangin round the street pretty woman  the kind i like to treat pretty woman  i don't believe you you're not

better i loved the james m cain source novel enough to tune in back then and i enjoyed this love capsule is the second time around for the longish red halter tops turbans ugly eyes and lush auburn locks of gold star samantha eggar who didn't try too hard in addition to recognizing a few of the incidental text from a childhood spent in front of the boob tube lee j cobb was able to hold my job as a worldweary tiredlooking keyes but richard crenna's affable and sir walter neff only reminded me of bill bixby on a sunny day improvement over the original was of course never intended in a rush to make a buck but more of a the retread a new adaptation of the novel would have been a novel idea cain's book differs somewhat from its various structure and the horrific shark fins in the moonlight ending is killer the completist in me is thankful this speeded up me decade update was included as part of the double disc dvd extras but the experience not only made me long to see the original it had me nostalgic for any episode of the bettermade columbo tv series i also flashed back to a very good abc tv movie of the week that i haven't seen since its initial airing john d macdonald's linda starring the beautiful stella stevens as a ruthless femme fatale who murders her lover's sexy john saxon wife and then frames her mildmannered husband for the crime and if i remember correctly there's also an openended ending like double what it was needlessly remade with tv series queen virginia madsen as the titular vixen and richard thomas as the milquetoast husband,0.6435475945472717,31,0.9389432485322896,Y,0.06783369803063458

extremely lame scene of the three friends buying clothes at the mall with some music playing in the background  we see them trying different clothes on like little girls given  to shop  get there hair cut  and then strutting off looking like slick gangsters one character  carlos  will from this point on wear sunglasses always  even at night the day before they leave  the leader of the group leaves to speak with the drug lord  leaving m and his friend to be dumb  they party up  take several samples of the drugs they're suppose to run  and break into thier old school  acting like animals and smashing everything in sight the movie ends when m tries calling his girlfriend  who hangs up on him  the friends then proceed to set the pay phone on fire  which brings out a bunch of kids and some

overall disposition has changed  and it falls into almost all of the pitfalls that plague bad anime  seven or eight friends and myself started watching this series on tv  by the end  only one friend

falls into a magical well near her family run shrine  when kagome comes out of the well again  she has been transported back in time to the feudal era of japan  she meets up with many other characters and they form a group of five or so companions who set off on a journey of revenge  justice  groping in one characters case  overall  they are trying to recover the pieces of the sacred jewel shard which enhances the power of demons who use it while there are many  many side stories and story arcs  there is no were near enough material to occupy episodes  the only story arc that is interesting enough to watch is still sort of dull the band of seven  after the half way mark in the series or maybe even before  it becomes painfully obvious that the plot is frozen in place and whoever made the series decided instead to put in dozens and dozens of filler episodes  these episodes have little to no impact on the story  and rarely even on the characters  in some cases  some characters who had an important role in the story will disappear for dozens of episodes at a time  many episodes follow the exact same cookie cutter patterns as the stories before it  inuyasha shoots windscar at enemy  windscar deflects  characters gasp in horror  enemy turns out to have barrier  characters spent three episodes trying to kill enemy before kagome finally fires sacred arrow at him and he turns to dust  also major spoiler  the conclusion will be revealed the lack of any conclusion makes it seem like you have waisted hours  major spoiler overthe animation itself is above average  and in some cases excellent  even so  reused animation cells plague most action scenes  and it is very hard to ignore them when it is clear that the exact same boulder has flown past a character five or six times in a row on the brighter side however  all of the characters are very well developed and the romances between some of the characters were truly captivating  also  the character designs  appearences  were brilliant and at times among the best i have seen  particularly with the band of seven  there is definitely no shortage of cosplay opportunities here  even so  i found myself hoping that a character would die just so there would be some sort of movement in the plot  and some of the humour in the show between characters is used again and again  one particular joke sit boy is found within the first five episodes  and you can literally expect it to be used again and again for the remaining episodes although there are some good aspects of the show and it is easy to see why it has a huge following  the series seems to be dominated by obsessed fan girls who drool over sesshomiru and inuyasha bottom line  definitely worth checking out  but not worth watching the whole series  the first episodes are very clever  original and enjoyable for anybody  but after that  it simply becomes dull and tedious  watching a tv show should never feel like a chore  but somehow this series accomplishes just

1,bonanza had a great cast of wonderful actors  lorne greene  pernell whitaker  michael landon  dan blocker  and even guy williams as the cousin who was brought in for several episodes during to replace adam when he was leaving the series  the cast had chemistry  and they seemed to genuinely like each other  that made many of their weakest stories work a lot better than they should have  it also made many of their best stories into great western drama like any show that was shooting over thirty episodes every season  there are bound to be some weak ones  however  most of the time each episode had an interesting story  some kind of conflict  and a resolution that usually did not include violence  while bonanza was a western  the gunfighting was never featured as the main attraction  while i am a fan of the rifleman and wante dead or alive  those shows usually ended with a gunfight  gunfights were how many westerns resolved every conflict  and bonanza was very different in trying to seek peaceful resolutions and harmony instead of killing in the early years of bonanza  there are some interesting episodes that do feature a lot of gunfights  those episodes stand in contrast to the rest of the series  but they are pretty good in and of themselves  in when pernell whitaker wanted to leave the show  guy williams was brought in to replace him  williams was playing the role of a longlost cousin  unfortunately  whitaker decided to stay one more year  and thus williams was written out of the series when he moved away to marry adam's old girlfriend  if williams had stayed on for the duration of bonanza  one can only wonder how much better the series would have been in the years after when pernell whitaker left the show undoubtedly  once pernell whitaker left the series  the

western drama  that is a pretty good record  even the worst of bonanza is better than a lot of other tv shows ,0.8968660831451416,0,bonanza had a small cast of wonderful actors lorne greene pernell whitaker michael landon middle blocker and even guy williams as the cousin who was brought in for three episodes during to replace adam when he was leaving the series the cast had chemistry and they seemed to genuinely like each other that made many of their weakest stories work a lot better than they should have it also made many of their best stories into great western drama like any show that was shooting over thirty episodes every season there are bound to be some weak ones however most of the time each episode had an interesting story some kind of conflict and a resolution that it did not include violence while there was a western the gunfighting was never featured as the main attraction while i am a fan of the rifleman and wante dead or living those shows usually ended with a gunfight gunfights were how many westerns resolved every conflict and bonanza was very disappointed in trying to seek peaceful resolutions and harmony instead of killing in the early years of bonanza there are some interesting episodes that do feature a lot of gunfights those episodes stand in contrast to the rest of the series but they are not good in and of themselves in when pernell whitaker wanted to leave the show guy williams was brought in to replace him williams was playing the role of a longlost cousin unfortunately whitaker decided to stay one more year and thus williams was written out of the series when he moved away to marry adam's former girlfriend if williams had stayed on for the duration of bonanza one can only wonder how much better the series would have been in the years after when david whitaker left the show undoubtedly once pernell whitaker left the series the stories focused more on comedy and country hijinks whitaker had often played the heavy in many

0,i remember seeing the very first trailer for underdog back last march  i also remember at the time smiling to myself ever so slightly  sure it was a cheesy idea  but i genuinely thought at the time the concept might work  hell it couldn't be any worse than the disappointing cats and dogs could it  then by december and i suddenly remembered the film i realised how likely the film was to suck  the fact it had been delayed in the uk made it seem inevitable it would be terrible  but the horrendous reviews just made me realise it was nigh on impossible for the movie to be any good  still i swallowed my feelings and went to see the film with a friend today  as i entered my screen i was mortified  it was the very first time i'd be seeing a movie with a friend and being the only two in the screen  little did i know for what i was about to endure  underdog to put it blunt is horrendous  it really is  imagine how bad you could think this movie is and then prepare yourself for a movie even worse  that is just how pathetic the movie is  while it aims to entertain kids it just seems an embarrassing mess that seems to insult kids rather than allow them to enjoy the movie  matters cannot be helped by the fact that the story is beyond lacklustre  the acting is generally poor  and the movie just feels like an overlong  tired and downright boring saturday cartoon  after a brief five minutes where i thought the movie might be passable the movie just suddenly seems to die and then limp on towards the already sign posted finale  i'm just amazed the movie was actually ever released  it's an embarrassment to disney  hell half their straight to video sequels are better than this  what's even more terrifying is the fact the ending leaves room for a sequel so lets get onto the acting cracks knuckles  okay let me be honest jason lee is decent  his voice suits the canine  and had he have been given a decent script he might have made the performance work  however  with such a dodgy script he just seems to flounder  in many ways it reminded me of bill murray in garfield  murray did what he could with what he had  but what he had wasn't enough to make it passable  then we get onto the human actors  and well the majority of atrocious  alex neuberger plays the friend of underdog  jack  my biggest concern is that anybody would even take him seriously in an audition  the scene where he gets to fly with underdog is perhaps the most cringe worthy scene in the past few years just because his acting is so poor  not once did i believe he was a real person  in fact part of me is still convinced he was a robot made specially for the movie  james belushi seems half dead in the film  he has nothing to work with  no decent lines  he just seems to wander around the set waiting to become relevant to the plot  which the writers try to do towards the end but do it in such a poor way its laughable  thankfully peter dinklage is the one redeeming factor of the movie  he is great as dr barsinister and seems to be having a laugh in the role  he steals every scene he is in  although that's hardly difficult when he shares screen time with the extremely annoying patrick warburton  the rest of the cast are even worse  especially taylor momsen  she just needs to end her acting career right now underdog also fails dramatically in terms of delivering anything like a funny scene  when the funniest scene involves underdog biting a can and causing dog food to explode everywhere you know there is something drastically wrong  this could be easily ignored if the movie had decent action or a good story  alas the movie is even worse in both of these terms  the effects are so ropey that any scene where underdog flies just seems absurd  and the dog uses his powers to such little effect that you frequently forget he has superpowers  what's the point in making a film about a super dog if the damned dog never appears super  the final fight also verges on embarrassing purely because its ten minutes of nothingness  the dog flies  other stuff happens  some stuff gets chucked about  all of this is irrelevant as this stuff is happening for the sake of stuff happening  the script as well is dodgy at best and downright pain inducingly awful at worst  when someone says look its a plane  no its a bird  no its a frog   yes you read that right  i just wanted to burst into tears there and then  actually i wanted to walk out by remained compelled to see whether it could get any lower than that point  this happens near the end so it doesn't thankfully overall underdog becomes the worst movie of at this early period  and is actually just as bad as last years epic movie  luckily for underdog  meet the spartans arrives over here soon and i expect that to be even worse  so in case you didn't get the point of my review  avoid the film at all costs  if you want to see a movie with a dog then watch cats and dogs  buy a real dog if necessary  just do not see this

0,office work  especially in this era of computers  multifunctional copy machines  email  voice mail  snail mail and temps ' is territory ripe with satirical possibilities  a vein previously tapped in such films as clockwatchers' and office space ' and very successfully  this latest addition to the temp  humor pool  however  haiku tunnel ' directed by josh kornbluth and jacob kornbluth  fails to live up to it's predecessors  and leaves the laughs somewhere outside the door  waiting for a chance to sneak in  unfortunately for the audience  that chance never comes  so what you get is a nice try  but as the man once said  no cigar  as the narrator  star of the film  josh kornbluth playing josh kornbluth  points out in the opening frames in a monologue delivered directly into the camera  this story is pure fiction  and takes place in the fictional city of san franc'l'isco ' it's an innovative  if not very imaginatively presented disclaimer  and not all that funny  it is  however  a harbinger of what is to follow  all of which like the disclaimer just isn't all that funny  kornbluth plays kornbluth  an aspiring novelist who supports himself working as a temp ' it's a job that suits him  and it gives him time to slip in some work on his novel from time to time  but when he goes to work for a lawyer  bob shelby warren keith  he does too good a job on the first day  and shelby dispatches head secretary marlina d'amore helen shumaker to kornbluth to persuade him to go perm ' the thought of working full time for the same company  though  initially strikes fear in the heart of kornbluth  but he caves in and signs on for the position  he's nervous about it  but at least now the other secretaries acknowledge his presence which  of course  they would never do with a

territory ripe with satirical possibilities a vein previously tapped in such films as clockwatchers' and office space ' and very successfully this latest addition to the temp humor pool however haiku tunnel ' directed by josh kornbluth and jacob kornbluth lived to live up to it's predecessors and leaves the laughs somewhere outside the door waiting for a chance to sneak in unfortunately for the audience that chance never comes so what you get is a nice try but as the man once said no cigar as the narrator star of the film josh kornbluth playing josh kornbluth points out in the opening frames in a monologue delivered directly into the camera this story is pure fiction and takes place in the fictional city of san franc'l'isco ' it's an innovative if not very imaginatively presented disclaimer and not all that funny it is however a harbinger of what is to follow all of which like the disclaimer just isn't all that funny kornbluth plays kornbluth an aspiring novelist who supports himself working as a temp ' it's a job that suits him and it gives him time to slip in some work on his mind from time to time but when he goes to work for a lawyer bob shelby warren keith he does too good a job on the first day and shelby dispatches head secretary marlina d'amore helen shumaker to kornbluth to persuade him to go perm ' the thought of working full time for the same company though initially strikes fear in the heart of kornbluth but he caves in and signs on for the position he's nervous about it but at least now the other secretaries acknowledge his presence which of course

1,i would probably not have bothered to comment on this film if i had not been disturbed by the constant references made to it here in north america as a porn film  our obsession with what is  or should be  regarded as pornographic remains a relic of the 'guidance' provided to film makers by the hayes committee many  many years ago and it is now really time that we relegate it to the past  so far we have not progressed far beyond establishing a somewhat arbitrary division between what we now term 'soft' and 'hard' porn  with both carrying the same pornography label  it is time for us all recognise that neither the r rated soft porn  release version of this film  nor the unrated version hard porn  available on dvd were in any way pornographic in legal terms pornography is defined by its capacity to deprave or corrupt  many classic books such as lady chatterley's lover  fanny hill  women in love  the story of 'o' or moll flanders have been prosecuted for pornographic content  tried by jury and cleared on the basis of this definition  but in practice most ordinary citizens are not interested in what they regard as legal equivocation  and apply a simpler test that is rather too stringent when applied to books or films which are very close to the line  but serves to quickly clear most others from any taint of pornography  although the hayes code would have rated aiw as unacceptable both for nudity and for its depictions of sexual activities  in practice most people today accept that where the basic message of a book or film is clearly designed to encourage the development of long term stable family relationships in which the participants find real fulfillment  it cannot be regarded as pornographic this does not mean that works depicting unsatisfactory or unstable relationships should be recognised as pornographic  only that these may need a more sophisticated assessment  in aiw  we have a film about a young female librarian who has had a rather sheltered upbringing  and keeps her suitor at arms length because of a feeling that this is what morality requires her to do  after he gets too frustrated by this and threatens to leave her  she falls asleep and dreams she is transported to a wonderland closely based on that of lewis carrol where everyone she meets is totally uninhibited about their sexual needs  she is shocked  but is a kind person who takes things as she finds them  so before long she finds her own prejudices gradually melting away  she wakes up when her boyfriend returns to break off their affair  but her attitude to him has changed so completely that their relationship is fully restored  and the film ends with them living 'happily ever after' with their children in a home with a white picket fence and a family dog  an ending clearly directed to those romantics who remain very young at heart pornographic   hardly  suitable viewing for children   well probably not quite  unless they have very progressive parents r rating   pg would be more appropriate today entertaining for viewers in most age groups   yes  but the film has its faults  these are discussed in many of the comments here on imdb  however most commentators clearly appreciated and enjoyed it i believe the only pornography associated with this film was the reported claim by an antipornography activist of scientific proof that a magazine picture of kristin debell was a photographic montage of images of the face of a ten year old with various body parts of adult models  these and other comments seriously damaged the career of a very promising young actress  but today the film appears to be on its way to becoming a cult classic  several home video productions have been released in both vhs and dvd format  the last was a dvd containing both the r rated and unrated versions of the film  released by subversive cinema in copies of this were readily available until a few months ago  now they are almost exhausted and the mail order vendors who still have copies in stock are selling them at many times their original price  a situation which usually quickly results in a new dvd release appearing  this continuing interest nearly years after the original film was released points to near classic status commentators on this database are expected to provide fellow viewers with useful guidance on whether a film is worth watching or even collecting  my comments here were intended to stress the ongoing damage to the industry that still results from pressure on major studios to respect selfcensorship recommendations originating with the hayes committee  on this database such general comments are very quickly marked by readers as 'not helpful' and i seldom make them  but fortunately i still have space to add that in my opinion this film is quite unusual and is well worth watching or even buying  it is flawed  but kristine debell gives a great performance and the film provides a fairly unique and rewarding viewing experience  overall i would rate it at stars and will be buying a copy of the next dvd edition if and when it appears  if ms debell is still alive today i would love to hear her comments both

pick the competitors for this program  this was literally a talentfree talent show  ok  perhaps that's an exaggeration  and granted  the performers all have to be relatively close in ability  because if they were not  there wouldn't be a contest  if only one person was good  there would be no suspense  so  i get that they all needed to be comparable  but they all should have had some chops  additionally  the judges were running a singing academy  so the program was part fame  as well  clearly these performers desperately needed those lessons  but you need some extremely talented people to teach those with little talent to be talented  and that definitely wasn't what was happening here it seemed in casting the show  the priority was on the homelife elements  as all of the players were very attractive to look at  in equal parts to how badly they vocalized  but the filmed segments in their house were so chopped and sliced  you couldn't get into the stories that were starting to happen  so the show didn't capture the events there  either as badly devised as all of that was  the one had an incredible  unbelievable  fatal design flaw built into the results that made it completely laughable the audience phoned in their votes for who they liked the best  just like on ai  but then  after the audience vote was revealed  the bottom three contestants were forced to sing a final song  the music experts  based on that performance  chose one person from the three to save for the following week  and then  the contestants who were safe got to vote for who they wanted to keep from the remaining two  sending the remaining contestant home the design flaw was that the contestants had the final say  i mean  if you were in a music competition and you wanted to get as far along the path as you could  would you vote to keep the better singer  or would you try to get rid of your toughest rival  any first season viewer of cbs's survivor could answer that one  and that's

they are both set in between the events of the first film  the first of these two straighttovideo films was beauty and the beast  the enchanted christmas which seems to be disliked by quite a few fans of its theatrical predecessor  but i think that can usually be expected with sequels  however  this second one  belle's magical world is definitely inferior the film features three short stories  all of which take place while belle is in the castle  and the place is under the spell of the enchantress  the first is the perfect word where a misunderstanding at the table between belle and the beast leads to trouble  and neither wants to be the first to apologize  the next story is fifi's folly where fifi and lumiere's fifth anniversary is coming up  and lumiere is unprepared  so belle helps him  however  fifi sees lumiere practicing romance with belle  and thinks they're actually in love  the film ends with the broken wing in this story  belle takes care of a bird with a broken wing  but a bird in the castle will probably mean trouble if the beast finds out  as he hates birds  the plot description i gave is for the original vhs version of disney's third beauty and the beast movie  apparently  in the dvd version  there is another story added called mrs  potts's party but i've only seen the original version  however  since i highly doubt that one story would stand out as a classic over the rest  i see no point in watching the special edition  anyway  the first thing i will say about belle's magical world is that the animation is very dimensional compared to what we're used to from disney  which would obviously disappoint many people  i didn't like beauty and the beast  the enchanted christmas that much  but you certainly can't say the same about its animation  i'm sure the stories in belle's magical world could entertain many kids mostly younger ones  i think  and each story has a moral  so they could also teach them some valuable lessons  however  for adults  the film really doesn't have a lot  i personally didn't find any good humour in it  found that the constant conflict between belle and the beast got tiring  and the stories did not impress me too much at all in any way they're not very well written  in the perfect word the way belle says to the beast  you're acting rude  and foolish  is a bit cheesy  and i think there are quite a few other cheesy moments in these stories by the time this straighttovideo movie first came out  i was around eleven or twelve years old  i don't know what i would have thought of it at the time  as i had lost interest in disney by then  and it would be years before i would gain any of that interest back  even when this movie was first released  i think i was a bit past the age group it was aimed at  i

around with a scrunched  sour face that indicates his nostrils just found the potato salad he misplaced a month ago   tons and tons of gore  well  if you're hungry for some so bad it's funny

some fun and make a game out of it  the filmmakers are nice enough to introduce us to each of the annoying delinquents by flashing their names and legal offenses on the screen  this makes it easier for you to write down which ones you want to see killed and in what order  you and your friends can see whose predictions are most accurate i also suggest that you and your pals write down every single moment of stupidity and inanity that you can find  tally them up at the end and see who comes up with the most  i think my grand total was  can you beat that  i personally want to know how after years and a fire does this abandoned hotel still have electricity  running water  and a working elevator i know  i know  the filmmakers are assuming that if you pay to see this then you obviously don't put much thought into what you spend your money on and therefore likely won't put much thought into how silly the movie is  but that doesn't mean we can't point it out and laugh at it i also like how the city wants to turn this huge hotel which would be condemned and recommended for demolition by any sensible inspector into a homeless shelter and they think the best way to get it cleaned up is to give eight punks a few mops and brooms  uhhuh i think you pretty much know what to expect  but i feel the need to provide you with a couple of warnings  first  if you hate crowd interaction no matter the movie then you might want to stay away  the people in the audience acted like they were at an actual wrestling show  shouts of kill him  kane  and i hope you die first  and chokeslam  echoed through the theater  showcasing what i hope is not the best of what america has to offer  i usually don't appreciate such audience interaction  but for a cheesefest like this i thought the commentary added to the entertainment value  however  i can see how others could be annoyed by it second  and this shouldn't even warrant explanation  the film doesn't shy away from the gore  if watching a big ugly dude rip eyeballs right out of their sockets doesn't scream fun night at the movies  for ya then you know good and well to save your dough i must say that i was a little surprised by the extreme lack of dialogue on kane's part  i wasn't expecting him to put on an acting clinic  but i was hoping he'd have some cute little catchphrase like say goodnight his character's last name is goodnight right before he killed a victim  instead he uttered four words in the entire film  no  and i see it  but hey  he delivered them flawlessly if i were a bad guy in a movie then my catchphrase would be something like place your betts  or all betts are off  it'd rule and you know it  we need a new genre term for bad horror films like see no evil that induce so much unintentional

didnt these people make jbj  why o why did i forget that for all the criticism the first half of the movie isn't that bad  there is some intrigue and you feel a sort of irritation mixed with excitement that i felt when seeing guy ritchie movies like lock stock and snatch kareena kapoor is sizzling in a very skinny model sort of way akshay kumar is akshay kumar as only he can be anil kapoor is annoying but kind of funny  you almost forget that most of the time you cannot understand him saif is sidey ala main khiladi  once again there is the occasional laugh and a few chuckles  and a few goosebumps during the kareenasaif love story kareena in the rain  behind me on my bike hm  but mostly this half promises more than it delivers  which makes the second half all the more unbearable  there was almost a cheer when the interval came not only because because of the wet kareena because of what people thought were the things to come instead we were treated to mind numbing torture which is difficult to put in words saif suddenly seam like a comic sidekick  suddenly the sexy kareena looks anorexic  you realise that the second last floor is now empty and her face looks to

0,well  i can honestly say that this is the first time that i experienced a film that had literally no meat or potatoes in it  the entire film felt like it was just the salad with no main course  the story line was fallible and laughable  the characters were onedimensional  the realism was out the window  and the animation was done by fouryear olds  does that cover it  i have never been more embarrassed for a concept in my entire life  i have never read the comics or seen the other programs with this character  but from the looks of the other reviews i am not off base with my observation to begin  the story moved too quickly  for someone new to this character and situations  i needed more built into creating the reasons instead of finding the solution  i have seen other anime if you could call this one an anime that do great things with their characters because they take the time to develop them  there was nothing set aside for lady death  in a few short scenes  we see her train with cremator and instantly become this aggressive shebeast of hell  this was hard for me to swallow  considering moments before she was introduced as this weak and feeble woman controlled by her father  suddenly  she is immersed with hatred and can do battle with an existence that has been around for millions of years  this was absurd  the presentation of lady death was poor  to say the least  i felt as if she was nothing more than an animated character instead of a desperate woman with revenge on the mind  for me  it just didn't work  she was nothing more than eyecandy for prepubescent boys wanting to ogle the mass quantities of skin that she suddenly grew on her chest when training with cremator  oh  i felt sick just watching her  the same goes for the character of cremator  who was this random person  the explanation they gave wasn't enough  and instead i was left with more incoherent babbling than actual development  it is a very sad day in hell when we forgo characters to show more violence and action  especially in an animated feature next  there was lucifer himself  let me just say that i think i could do battle with the king of hell and survive  he was weak  his voice was laughable  and he just didn't represent the image that i had in my mind  it was as if disney was in control and wanted to make him semipc  he lacked the darkness and corrupt nature that lucifer embodies  he was not the ruler of hell  but instead just a lackey that had a bigger place to live  speaking of living or dying  how can you die again in hell  that was a concept that definitely needed more explanation  most of the characters were worrying about dying  when they didn't even consider the option that they were already dead  that is how they got to hell  i think it was this level of thinking that ruined the film for me  i didn't quite capture the notion that your soul was still in a solid body in hell  but that could just be me or maybe it was because there was no development in this story  there was nothing built  just preparing the battle sequences were hysterically bad  the animation in this cartoon felt like it was made in the early s  there was nothing impressive about the way that this film was drawn  why are we  america  so behind on animation  it is huge in asia  and it is creeping in hardcore here because we keep making films like lady death that do not challenge or use any part of imagination  we are cheap  and this film shows it overall  this film was bad  the animation coupled with the horrendous voice work was cheap  i had head somewhere that this film as in production for a long time  which is hard to understand because i think i could have made this film on my credit card  the production was horrendous as well as the story  nothing was developed  leaving huge gaping plot holes that nearly everyone fell into  the strength of the characters was missing  and nothing was explained  i wasted my time with this one and would

and does joe end up with susie  who loves him too the first and second times i saw anchors aweigh  i also saw it at the same time as i did on the town  the kelly  sinatra collaboration from both times i felt that anchors aweigh was the better film in terms of plotting and structureall the dances and songs fit the moment in the plot  and they develop the characters and story rather than hamper them  yet  both times i came away feeling that on the town is the better film overall  having now seen both films a third time  i still stand by that judgement  somehow on the town  as a film and a piece of entertainment  is just lighter  gayer  purely and simply happier the numbers are more outrageous and less integral to the plot  and yet somehow it works better than all the dances and singing in anchors aweigh  i'm not quite sure why this is  the typical argument is that the latter film is overlong  at almost two and a half hours  this is certainly a valid criticism to make  i certainly felt the length the first two times i saw it  however  it's also a film that grows on youthe more you see it  the shorter it feels and the more you appreciate the technical mastery involved in its making  and yet  something just doesn't hang together quite right  it feels almost as if the script was pored over  and every single moment when kelly could break into dance or sinatra into song was noted  and that's exactly what happened  no opportunity to shoehorn a musical number in was given up  and that's probably the film's biggest weakness  it has numbers give or take a few  and no matter how big a fan you are of kelly or sinatra  this really starts to turn one numb after a while  contrast this  for example  with the ten numbers in on the town  you might well feel that each song  each dance  can't be taken out of the film without leaving it lacking  and that's true  but that's also because the writers weren't more restrained in adding them in in the first place all this long preamble doesn't mean there's nothing good about anchors aweigh  the musical is splashy with great songs bursting out all over  like the duets between kelly and sinatra 'we hate to leave' 'i begged her' and 'if you knew susie'  the singing of sinatra 'what makes the sunset' 'the charm of you' and the best of all  'i fall in love too easily'  and without a doubt the always inventive  always breathtaking dancing of kelly  it's also hard to miss with a cast of this calibre  grayson is sweet and seems to improve on each viewing her voice becoming stunning rather than frightening jose iturbi's role is written sympathetically and he does a great job with it  even clarence's own brooklyn  pamela britton  is cute and charming  as close as one could get to betty garrett without being garrett herself  sinatra is adorable with those blue eyes and curls of his  and plays the innocent boyman wonderfully a role he reprises in on the town  his singing is  as usual  simply faultless from enunciation through to timing and phrasing  his solo numbers might seem to drag a little  but when you've got the voice of a century  showcasing it is probably as good a reason as any to slow up the rest of the film gene kelly's sheer genius in this film is worthy of its own paragraph  third in the billing behind sinatra and grayson respectively  anchors aweigh really is kelly's film  his joe brady is a believable  real characterhe's tough on the outside  glib and willing to lie when necessary to win a gal  but he's actually the biggest softy on the inside  kelly makes this charming rather than cloying  but also gives joe a real edge that you see in the scene when joe chases brooklyn around the room with a genuinely murderous look on his face and his breakfast tray in his hands  and the dancingagain  the film suffers from the 'too much of a good thing spoils the effect' syndrome  as it does with sinatra's singing  but once again  if it's gene kelly doing the softshoe  or tapping across the screen in a sailor's outfit or dressed up as a bandit chief  might as well err on the side of overdoing it  all of kelly's dances are breathtaking  be it the pareddown simplicity of his tap number with sinatra to 'i begged her' his 'mexican hat dance' with the sweet wideeyed little girl  or his lavish spanishinfluenced dance 'la cumparsita' of course  the classic image left in audiences' minds for all time would be kelly in his red  white and blue sailor suit  dancing with jerry mouse of 'tom  jerry' fame  a welldeserved golden film memory  to be sureit's not often that one can say you're impressed by the special effects in a film made in given the saturation of cgi in the contemporary film market  but gene and jerry still look great  with kelly always hitting his spots and looking exactly where he needs to look  it would turn out that just about the only people who could really keep up with gene kelly would be kelly himself in cover girl and a cartoon animation  it's doubtless that this first daring  inventive kelly dance with jerry has reserved a place for anchors aweigh in film history and the hearts of classic film buffs  but it's also notable for being the

talent to create  three production companies were required to make this amazing documentary film earth   convincingly tells the stories of four species on their great migrations as it spans one year through the seasons beginning in january and ending in december  from the north pole to the south pole two special new hightech cameras were used for this film  one camera has a degree computer controlled motorized rotating lens and the other is a hd camera set to an amazing frames per second  this filming technique really added drama and beauty to some of the scenes of earth   especially the cheetah chase and great white sharks leaping out of the water to catch sea lions and an aerial view going over the edge of the world's highest waterfall  there are many stunningly beautiful shots in this documentary via cinematography  music score and narration  there is drama  sadness  humor and great beauty in this documentary  with a great music score performed by the world renowned berliner philharmoniker  excellent creative and technical cinematography and james earl jones narration  i consider earth   as the greatest nature feature length documentary film ever made five years of hard work  patience  talent and dedication really paid off very well here  this film should be required viewing in all schools throughout the world  i predict an academy award for best documentary

while trying to do so he catches a pregnant female  injuries it to the extent she aborts her unborn foetus on deck which makes a mess  enrages her mate  nolan orders the whale be dumped back in the

series of attacks on the town  it's people in an effort to lure nolan back out to sea for a fight to the death  directed by michael anderson i thought this blatant ripoff was terrible  i'm sorry but i thought it was just plain ridiculous  utterly dull even at a modest odd minutes  the script by producer luciano vincenzoni  sergio donati is so stupid i'm lost for words  the fact that it seems to take itself very seriously doesn't help  if i have to listen to charlotte rampling go on about how intelligent killer whale's are just one more time i'll scream  i'm sorry but i simply don't believe a killer whale is intelligent enough to know who any particular boat belongs to  sink it  i don't believe a killer whale can cause a huge explosion including knocking an oil lantern from a wall on the opposite side it hits as there is no way on earth it could know it was there  i don't believe a killer whale can identify someone's house  know someone is in there  then wreck it on purpose  i don't believe a killer whale can move icebergs around in order to trap a boat  i don't believe killer whales can physically recognise people  i don't believe it has any revenge instincts or at least none that are as strong as this dumb film makes out  maybe i'm being a bit harsh  i mean it's only a film after all but it's a film which is trying to be serious  things just got so ridiculous that i was half expecting the killer whale to write a letter to nolan to tell him his plan  hand or should that be fin  deliver it  the thing seemed intelligent enough to do just about anything else  they should have asked it to come up with a cure for the common cold  seriously  that's a statement that's no more far fetched than anything else in this film  i found the film very boring  totally dull  had awful character's with no on screen presence at all  it goes without saying this is a jaws  ripoff which doesn't even come close to spielberg's classic director anderson is no spielberg that's for sure  this rubbishy film has absolutely no suspense  scares  tension or atmosphere at all  all the attack scenes are as dull as dishwater  totally forgettable  there's no build up to them  virtually no pay off either as orca doesn't get to eat a single person  then there's the scenes which literally had me laughing  the shots of the killer whale appearing to cry are pure comedy  the opening scenes of the two killer whales i suspect tried to show them as a 'loving'  'caring' couple but i couldn't help but think that this is the closest we'll ever get to killer whale porn  hilarious stuff  the footage of the killer whales themselves is bland  boring  instead of footage which matches  enhances the scenes around it it just looks like dreary wildlife documentary footage that has little connection to anything else  do you get the impression that i don't like this film  good  forget about any gore or decent deaths either  there's a brief scene when bo derek has her legs bitten off but blink and you'll miss it this probably had quite a big budget  it still sucks  there's nothing outstanding about orca  it's well made i suppose but flat  bland  totally forgettable  the cinematography is quite nice though  the acting is bad  rampling is awful  the late harris' irish accent is embarrassing orca is a lame jaws ripoff which completely ignores or messes up everything that made

0,i'd have to say that i've seen worse sci fi channel originals  but this nu image shonker from yossi wein was still quite a drag  the big problem with it is that it simply isn't convincing  not just its creature  but acting  writing and any attempts at drama  the direction lacks any kind of flair and the script from boaz davidson and danny lerner never really works  predictable  often laughable  whilst it delivers less howlers than a fair few of these sorts of films it never offers anything to engage or raise the pulse  the actors do their best  but with such material their workmanlike efforts have little effect  matthew reilly burke is a blandly watchable hero  meredith morton similar as a blandly watchable love interest  actually she was a bit less convincing but at least she was easy on the eyes  the film at least has the dignity to bowl along at a reasonable pace  but its biggest plus is that the octopus isn't entirely cgi rendered  so even though it doesn't look good  at least there are a few legit scenes of characters inanely grappling with rubbery tentacles in pretty amusing fashion  i also chuckled at the disparities between different representations of the octopus  the cgi shots of the creature as a whole vary over the course of the film  they are also different not only in size but appearance to the practical shots of it  and there are scenes where the tentacle action suggests that the makers had abandoned pretending they were making a film about an octopus and just envisioned their creature as a bunch of miscellaneous tentacles  the scenes of the creature attacking people get old pretty swiftly  but there are a few funny scenes where it takes on other things  like a boat and a crane  yes  these scenes are poor  but they did make me chuckle  undisputable highlight though is a hilarious sequence in which the octopus takes on a new york landmark  the scene may not be much more than a minute but it really is inspired  and well worth looking up on youtube  apart from that things are uninspired all round  a pg level lack of gore or nastiness stops this one from even pulling off much in the trash good times the film does take a turn into semi gripping disaster movie territory at the end  but i can't really give it credit because the best shots in the last few scenes were culled from the stallone flick daylight which by my recollection is quite good  altogether this was pretty rubbishy stuff and not something i'd really recommend to anyone except creature feature die hards  better than a poke in the eye with a wet stick  but not by

history of this famous summer and in my opinion  none of the others can compare  it fibbed a little at certain details  but those parts did not take away from the sheer elegance and romance of the story  i have seen the other movies about this summer and i find most of them to be good  but none as captivating as this one haunted summer has the qualities of a painting  the colors and settings seem to be something one would find on a canvas  framed and hung in a museum or on the walls of an eccentric's home  the costumes were gorgeous and  despite not being the most comfortable clothes in the world  made me want to find a seamstress to create such garb for myself  the whole movie was set on the picturesque lake geneva where i hope to one day go because of seeing this movie and the serenity that these historical figures found there this movie shows  besides the tranquility found by all the escapees of england's harsh judgements  the strangeness that surrounded this adventure as well  yes  there were drugs  it was a fairly common practice during that time  a time when drugs were not illegal  and the taking of laudanum the liquid form of opium was medicinal as well as recreational  shelley suffered from consumption  lord byron suffered the pains of a clubbed foot  it was not surprising that there would be prescriptions of the strong drugs that were in their possession during that summer  and they were poets during a time when experience was the key  there was no time for prudish caution  passion and experience were a big part of the romantic era  and out of the thoughts and discussions of science  religion and philosophy came the creation of a legen frankenstein yes  in this movie  we see the beautiful and liberated mary godwin not married to shelley at that time played by beautiful and talented alice krige  she is the control factor to all that goes on until she  too  gives in to experience  but she stands her ground and experiences things on her own terms  as was the strength that she inherited from her mother and father the actors and actresses in this were perfect for the parts they played  the music fitting  the direction captured the essence of the summer  as i've read about it  this movie was based on a wonderful book haunted summer by anne edwards  if you like this movie  read the book  the author takes the story from what she was able to put together from the actual journals of mary godwin shelley and the other participants of this story if you are a person who loves history even the little inaccuracies from time to time

1,i would probably not have bothered to comment on this film if i had not been disturbed by the constant references made to it here in north america as a porn film  our obsession with what is  or should be  regarded as pornographic remains a relic of the 'guidance' provided to film makers by the hayes committee many  many years ago and it is now really time that we relegate it to the past  so far we have not progressed far beyond establishing a somewhat arbitrary division between what we now term 'soft' and 'hard' porn  with both carrying the same pornography label  it is time for us all recognise that neither the r rated soft porn  release version of this film  nor the unrated version hard porn  available on dvd were in any way pornographic in legal terms pornography is defined by its capacity to deprave or corrupt  many classic books such as lady chatterley's lover  fanny hill  women in love  the story of 'o' or moll flanders have been prosecuted for pornographic content  tried by jury and cleared on the basis of this definition  but in practice most ordinary citizens are not interested in what they regard as legal equivocation  and apply a simpler test that is rather too stringent when applied to books or films which are very close to the line  but serves to quickly clear most others from any taint of pornography  although the hayes code would have rated aiw as unacceptable both for nudity and for its depictions of sexual activities  in practice most people today accept that where the basic message of a book or film is clearly designed to encourage the development of long term stable family relationships in which the participants find real fulfillment  it cannot be regarded as pornographic this does not mean that works depicting unsatisfactory or unstable relationships should be recognised as pornographic  only that these may need a more sophisticated assessment  in aiw  we have a film about a young female librarian who has had a rather sheltered upbringing  and keeps her suitor at arms length because of a feeling that this is what morality requires her to do  after he gets too frustrated by this and threatens to leave her  she falls asleep and dreams she is transported to a wonderland closely based on that of lewis carrol where everyone she meets is totally uninhibited about their sexual needs  she is shocked  but is a kind person who takes things as she finds them  so before long she finds her own prejudices gradually melting away  she wakes up when her boyfriend returns to break off their affair  but her attitude to him has changed so completely that their relationship is fully restored  and the film ends with them living 'happily ever after' with their children in a home with a white picket fence and a family dog  an ending clearly directed to those romantics who remain very young at heart pornographic   hardly  suitable viewing for children   well probably not quite  unless they have very progressive parents r rating   pg would be more appropriate today entertaining for viewers in most age groups   yes  but the film has its faults  these are discussed in many of the comments here on imdb  however

promising young actress  but today the film appears to be on its way to becoming a cult classic  several home video productions have been released in both vhs and dvd format  the last was a dvd

1,if it is true that sadomasochism is a twosided coin which contains the whole in the diverse expression of its opposites  then the cinematic portrait of erika kohut has its reality  professor kohut treats her piano students with a kind of fascist sadism while longing for the same for herself  her outward expression projects her desire  that is why she can hurt without guilt or remorse along comes talented  charming  handsome young walter klemmer benoit magimel who is attracted to her because of her passion and her intensity  he wants to become her student so as to be close to her  she rejects him out of hand  but because of his talent the vienna conservatory votes him in  he falls in love with her  again she pushes him away  but he will not take no for an answer  and thereby begins his own descent into depravity and loss of selfrespect the question the viewer might ask at this point is  who is in control  the sadist or the masochist  indeed who is the sadist and who the masochist  it is hard to tell  is it the person who has just been greatly abused both psychologically and physically  who is actually lying wounded on the floor in grotesque triumphant and fulfillment  or is it the person who is rushing out the door  sated  giving the order that no one is to know what happened but erika is not just a sadomasochistic freak  she is a sex extreme freak  she wants to experience the extremes of human sexuality while maintaining the facade of respectability  actually that isn't even true  she says she doesn't care what others think  she doesn't care if they walk in and find her bleeding on the floor because she is in love  love  she calls it  for her sex and love are one and the same at one point walter tells her that love isn't everything  how ironic such a superfluity is to her  how gratuitous the comment the movie is beautifully cut and masterfully directed by michael haneke who spins the tale with expert camera work and carefully constructed sets in which the essence of the action is not just clear but exemplified as in the bathroom when walter propels himself high above the top of the stall to find erika within  he also employs a fine positioning of the players so that they are always where they should be with well timed cuts from one angle to another  this is particularly important in the scene in which erika  like a blooddrained corpse caught in stark white and black light  lies under her lover  rigid as stone  here for the most part we only see her face and the stark outline of her neck with its pulsating artery  we don't need to see any more the part of erika kohut is perfect for isabelle huppert who is not afraid of extremes  indeed she excels in them  i have seen her in a number of movies and what she does better than almost anyone is become the character body and soul  like the woman she plays in this movie she is unafraid of what others may think and cares little about her appearance in a decorative sense  what matters to her is the performance and the challenge  no part is too demanding  no character too depraved  it's as if huppert wants to experience all of humanity  and wants us to watch her as she does  she is always fascinating and nearly flawless  she is not merely a leading light of the french cinema  she is one of the great actresses of our time who has put together an amazingly diverse body of work i think it is highly instructive and affords us a wonderful and striking contrast to compare her performance here with her performance in the lacemaker la dentelli√®re from when she was years old  there she was apple sweet in her red hair and freckles and her pretty face and her cute little figure playing pomme  a parisian apprentice hairdresser  her character was shy about sex and modestjust an ordinary french girl who hoped one day to be a beautician  here she is a selfdestructive witch  bitter with hateful knowledge of herself  shameless and entirely depraved huppert is fortunate in being an actress in france where there are parts like this for women past the age of starlets  hollywood could never make a movie like this  in the american cinema  only a handful of the very best and hardest working actresses can hope to have a career after the age of about thirty  huppert greatly increases her exposure because of her ability and range  but also because she is willing to play unsympathetic roles  here and also in la c√©r√©monie  in which she plays a vile  spiteful murderess do see this for isabelle huppert  you won't forget her or the character she brings

is played by a mongolian actress  albeit a lame performance  but she is pretty  which redeems a bit the lack of performance on her part but  i totally failed to understand what was the point of this painfulto watch piece of hour fantasy created by mr bodrov  the plot totally lacked any sense of cohesion  there was no logic behind the development of the plot  in fact  there was hardly any story at all  just a number of loosely tied scenes with a bunch of guys in mongolian clothes  speaking some kinda pidgin that is supposed to sound like mongolian  most actors were either japanese  russian or chinese  most scenes were shot in china  kazakhstan or russia and there were a lot of disturbing pathos about what is it to be a mongolian the dialog is primitive and the scenes with dialog are slow  the battle scenes are laughable  all the supernatural pathos is lame and is obviously there only to make up for the lack of the story the japanese actor was like a wooden doll  and looking at him one wouldn't get any idea how this person could become a leader who could unite the nomadic tribes  he looked sleepy  soft  stiff and pitiful for the most part of the movie and i don't even want to start on the subject of the historical relevance of this piece of cinematic waste  to see chinggiskhan half of the movie as a slave  to see his two first kids be born from other men  to see his wife selling herself to the tangut merchant  my blood starts to boil  and where is the beautiful story about the friendship between temujin and jamukha  one could make a great movie out of it  where is the story of the rise of temujin  of his childhood  of his relationship with his family  with his brothers  of how he struggled to survive among mighty enemies of his family  where is van khan  who helped him a lot  where is the depiction of life in the steppe  of the life of the nomads  of their traditions  of their relations with the other nations around them where is development of the characters  we totally fail to see what brought temujin together with jamukha and what brought them apart and most important  how temujin became chinggiskhan  how he  an outcast with no wealth and military power managed to unite the mongolian tribes and create such an organized and effective war machine that crushed one nation after another and created the largest land empire in history  all this could make

one by one by a monster  there turns out to be no reason for the reporter  one of the characters has some past demons where his ex girlfriend drowns in a cave years ago  there seems to be no relevance or reason for that either  just a rubbish attempt at character building i assume  anyway  the monster turns out to be a guy that wandered into the cave as a normal little kid and has lived in there all his life  this for no reason makes him superhuman  able to glow  see in the dark  take bullets  breathe underwater  be in places at once and have insane strength able to move boulders  carry grown men as dead weight  etc  in the end scene there are women left alive  they wake up naked  just covered in some bit of rug or something  they then find a picture of a kid  the monster then bursts in

and quite literally goes raaah  like a kiddie on halloween  i was watching it with my boyfriend and at that point he literally burst out laughing  the guy then sees a picture of himself as a kid and has a flashback to him sitting under a tree with his face all burnt and then getting up and wandering into the cave  that is the extent of the back story to why he mutilates people and it leaves you feeling a bit cheated for a story  the monster then kills one of the women and brutally rapes the other one  cut to end credits  i know the rape scene was designed to be shocking  but as a woman it just made me feel quite ill and was the thing that affected me the most in the whole film  he could have killed her and cut her into pieces and ate her and it would have been less horrific than the rape scene there are so many things that are left unanswered at the end  aside from all this  the scenes where there was minutes at a time of just black and nothing else was annoying and the constant nauseating camera angles where it's all upside down and you can't see what's going on wound me up so much at one point i almost turned it off  an absolutely terrible film  you might as well get the

1,if vampire tales are your cup of blood  then this gothfest based on the anne rice vampire chronicles should prove to be a satisfying experience  a veritable consortium of the undead in a

ventures forth to investigate  what he finds is a world filled with new sounds  a new kind of music driving and penetrating sounds that assault the senses and make him feel alive and welcome  and he knows that at long last his time has come  that it is time for him and those like him to come out into the open and face the world on their terms  toward that end he becomes the front man for a band a singer and performer unlike any the world has ever known  he presents himself as a vampire  and very quickly amasses a following that extends far beyond london where it all begins  and will ultimately take him to death valley  california  where he plans to give a concert that promises to be beyond anything anyone has ever seen or experienced  lestat is powerful  without question  but there are those of his kind who do not take favorably to the fact that he has revealed them  one of whom is marius vincent perez  a vampire powerful in his own right the vampire  in fact  who made' lestat so many years before and they are gathering  coming together and making their plans to meet lestat at the concert  and they are not going for the music  but there is something else  as well  at one point

chosen to rule by her side as her king  lestat  and at the concert  rest assured  akasha will be in attendance  without fail  make no mistake  this is lestat's story  and rymer presents it amid a setting rich with atmosphere and with some exquisite moments  though his film has less bite to it than say  interview with the vampire ' or bram stoker's dracula ' he sets a good pace  and there are some scenes that provide some real thrills  but overall the film isn't as soaked in menace as it could be  or as much as one might expect  in the final tally  in fact  the amount of flesh that is incinerated wins out over actual bloodletting  though there is more than a taste of gore  and more than a fair share of lips and mouths dripping with the red stuff  there's some good f  x on hand  too  especially in the sequences that accentuate the speed of the vampires  as they move and hurtle through the air faster than the naked eye can discern  it's a decent job by rymer  but he could have put more teeth into it had he played up the alienation hinted at by lestat  as it is  you get a sense of his detachment  but not enough to get you totally involved  in interview with the vampire ' tom cruise brought some charismatic star power to the role of lestat  but townsend is even more effective  with a look and an attitude that captures lestat perfectly  he plays him with a sense of acceptance  and under closer scrutiny you may even find a hint of remorse and longing  it's a good performance  and one that sells his character convincingly  as marius  vincent perez does a nice job  too he is  in fact  one of the strengths of the film though his character is a bit ambiguous  that  however  has more to do with the way he was written than with perez's performance  which is quite good  turning in noteworthy performances  as well  are marguerite moreau  as jesse  a young woman too curious for her own goo and the gorgeous lena olin as maharet  jesse's aunt  who ultimately plays a pivotal role in the outcome of the drama involving lestat and akasha  and as akasha  aaliyah is an absolutely riveting presence  what more can one say about her other than she is a gifted performer  with tremendous talent and beauty  and  tragically  she has left us much too soon  the supporting cast includes paul mcgann  david   christian manon  mael   claudia black  pandora   bruce spence  khayman   matthew newton  armand   tiriel mora  roger  and megan dorman  maudy   with a much stronger story than the usual offerings of this particular genre  anne rice fans  especially  will be pleased with queen of the damned ' a film nicely crafted and delivered by director rymer and his engaging cast  by focusing attention on the drama of the story and the way it's presented rather than

appears over years old  yuck the female grows increasingly scared and she discovers the house she lives in was once a haven for serial killings and murders which bring about the end to the movie  they find the friendly landlord murdered which makes no sense since ghosts need to take a human form to kill and decide to get the hell out of dodge  while packing up  the husband moronically goes up into

probably more realistic scenario ended up being used  however  to fit the spirit of the first film  die hard was mostly a fun action movie  here  that grimmer and more convincing edge is pervasive  the violence is bloody  the one liners are hilarious  but with a certain style that more echoes natural human sarcasm than clich√©d film wisecracks at key moments of action  the plot is also packed with more malicious intent than most action films  the villain is not just some rogue out for revenge or a mad grab at power  it is less ridiculous  but also more frightening than that  from recent

1,i have looked into the eye of this island  and what i saw was beautiful  proclaims one of the main characters in abc's award winning television show lost the series could be summarized as a drama story about a group of plane crash survivors stranded on an unknown island  but that would be doing the show a disservice  lost follows a large group of characters who come into conflict with the island  each other  and ultimately themselves as they struggle with their new way of life and their dependency on each other  the situation becomes more complicated when it becomes clear this isn't an ordinary island  either  and that they may not be alone my initial fear after hearing the concept of this series was the lack of new stories they could tell us after a certain period  but this proved to be unfounded  the narrative flows naturally  the dialogue is witty  the characters are memorable and the execution is superb  the island is a character all on its own  and to understand this comment you'd have to see the series for yourself  which only goes to show its originality and greatness at the time of writing this review  only the first two seasons have aired  and they're filled with strong episodes  my only mild criticism is that the second season seems to slow down a bit halfway  but then fortunately comes back in admirable shape for the final episodes if i can recommend one television series you should be following right now  it would certainly be this one  if you like excitement  adventure  character driven stories  an extremely strong cast and crew  beautiful locations  and an island that seems more spiritual than natural  lost is for you  just be sure you start at the beginning ,0.992171049118042,0,i have fallen into the eye of this island and what i saw was god proclaims salvation of the main characters in abc's prize money television show lost the series could be summarized as a drama story about a group of plane crash survivors stranded on an unknown island but that could be doing the show a disservice lost follows a large group of characters who come into conflict with the island each other and ultimately themselves as they struggle with their new way of life and their dependency on each other the situation becomes more complicated when it becomes clear this isn't an ordinary island either and that they may not be alone my first fear after hearing the concept of this series was the lack of new stories they could tell us after a certain period but this proved to be unfounded the narrative flows naturally the dialogue is for the characters are memorable and the execution is at the island is a character all on its own and to understand this comment you'd have to see the series for yourself which only goes to show its originality and greatness at the expense of writing this review only the first two seasons have changed and they're filled with six episodes my only serious criticism is that the second season seems to slow down a bit halfway but then fortunately comes back in bad shape for the final episodes if i can recommend one television series you should be following right now it would certainly be this one if you wanted excitement adventure character driven by an extremely strong ship and ship at locations and an island that seems more unnatural than natural lost is for you just be sure you start at the beginning,0.4828752875328064,20,0.9435989256938228,Y,0.06756756756756757
1,this comment does contain spoilers  there are few actors that have an intangible to them  that innate quality which is an amalgamation of charisma  panache and swagger  it's the quality that can separate good actors from the truly great  i think george clooney has it and so does jack nicholson  you can look at clooney's subtle touches in scenes like his one word goodbye to andy garcia in ocean's when they just utter each other's name disdainfully  terry  danny  you can pick any number of jack's performances dating as far back as five easy pieces in the diner to a few good men and his court room interrogation scene  these guys just have it  you can add denzel washington to the small and exclusive list of actors who exudes that terrific trait in everything he does  if you look at some of his explosive borderline diatribes in the siege to his impressive tribute to malcolm x in spike lee's film of the same name  you can see that there is no finer an actor working today  i don't mention all of this to insinuate that man on fire is perfect just because of denzel's work  but he is definitely the cog of the production  i was literally mesmerized with some of his scenes that are raw  emotional and incendiary all at the same time washington plays creasy a former spy or cia agent or one of those covert government operatives  he has pretty much hit rock bottom as he has become disillusioned with the life that he has led  he has killed and perhaps done things that are best left unsaid and this has made him a hardened and bitter man  his friend and perhaps mentor  played very reservedly by christopher walken  is living in mexico making a very comfortable living by providing body guard services for the rich  apparently the kidnapping business in mexico is so vibrant that these paid former s e a l s and such can do very well while providing a needed service  creasey needs the work and accepts a job with a well to do family who seems to be in some financial difficulty  marc anthony is fine as samuel  radha mitchell is tantalizingly sexy as his wife lisa and dakota fanning is just unbelievably and precociously brilliant as pita  i don't know how a child of her age can have such range to play the characters that she does but her interpretation of pita is nothing short of oscar worthy  the film's entire first half is dependent on the relationship between pita and creasy and if there was a weaker actress in the role  perhaps that emotional synergy would not have come across so succinctly  but fanning is nothing short of remarkable in the role it is the relationship between pita and creasy that drives this film to the apex of cinema  together they are perfect and there is a real bond developed between them  tony scott directs with a frenetic urgency and his eye for visual flare has never been better  i am interested to see how his next film  domino  turns out  i think scott is one of today's under rated directors and with more films like this one  his name will surely be elevated to icon status the story has creasy really taking to pita  and visca versa  there is a definite connection between the two of them and perhaps it stems from the fact that although pita loves her dad  he is not around much  he is a philanthropist and obviously has little time to spend with his family  soon  creasy is taking pita to her swimming competition  he is reading her bedtime stories and she is naming her teddy bear creasy it's not just a friendship between them  it is more of a kinship  and a deep parental love seems to be present  the film changes gears when pita does get kidnapped and held for ransom and creasy is is almost fatally injured trying to protect her  this is where the story becomes thick with innuendo and ripe with deceit as the plot pieces get unraveled like an onion  and this is where denzel becomes a tour de force  like i said earlier  i have seen denzel give some outstanding performances in films like crimson tide and training day  but never have i seen him like this  he is a man possessed and with the possibility of pita being dead  he becomes a literal man on fire  it rages in him as he hunts down and dishes out his brand of comeuppance  denzel's anger and acerbity are ubiquitous and not easily quelled as he hunts down each person responsible for pita's violation  this all vigilante justice as the mexican authorities always seem to be one step behind  also what is paramount to this film's audacious brilliance is that there are few films that actually give the criminals their due comeuppance  i have often been frustrated to watch films where the bad guys get let off easily  they inflict all kinds of torment for the entire film and then they take a bullet and die  but not in this film  writer brian helgeland sees to it that retribution here is unequivocal and it is painful  the perpetrators here feel creasy's wrath and they experience the torment that he unleashes  there is nothing gimmicky about his brand of justice  he needs information and someone loses a finger  he wants answers and a homemade bomb is placed in places that are meant for other things  there is no punches pulled here and this is one of the true strengths of the film man on fire is one the five best films of now that it is out on dvd  my recommendation is to get the se  it is loaded with bonus features that include about hours of documentaries and different commentary tracks   ,0.9910146594047546,0,this comment does contain that there are few actors that have an intangible to them that innate

0,okay they tell you it's real  they don't list any screenwriters or directors  but one viewing of this movie will prove to anyone  it's not real in the way you were hoping for  the speaking rarely sounds like real natural talk  but also down not sound to be scripted  possibly loosely scripted  to me it sounded much more like they were always trying to adlib  which they almost always did poorly  therefore  they knew they were making a 'movie' not just collecting real natural footage  so i'm sure these people knew what was going on  knew they had certain spots to look for things that were set up  and they were just told to adlib around it all 'major spoilers' okay  it's so lame  every item  spot or thing that could be strange or use d as a scare  is magically stumbled upon by these people  let me list off the ridiculously obviously faked things that happened that i remember  less than minutes of entering the house  they turn a light switch on  the light sparks and a chandelier almost falls on a guy they happen to find an old medical bag with a bloody butcher knife in it  while exploring the cellar they hear a noise in an armoire  so they open the door slowly  bam  a cat happens to be in there and jumps straight at the camera while shrieking then they happen to notice there is a hole in the wall  so let's stick our hand in  wow  they pulled out a doll of a baby wrapped in mummy tape let's go to the attic  uhoh it feels 'heavy' up here  boom  a chair flies across the room time to eat  oh no  the girl that was scared of bugs had a roach in her sandwich  lol  ridiculous let's get out the ouija board  oops one of the legs on the planchette fell off the side of the board  that couldn't be because the people were pushing it could it  they find out a ghost there is named charles wait  what was that noise in the chimney  clink  oh my shackles fell out i think she kept people up here now wimpy girl is going to brave looking up the chimney shaft  oh  what's this she sees something  and is asking people who aren't looking up the chimney what it is  swish  it falls off straight at her  perfect camera shot she moves just in time  it was more chain now we have to separate and each 'cleanse' our designated rooms  wouldn't it be something if things started happening one by one to these people now  okay chick  wow  suddenly her room is shaking  but no one elses does dude  actually says to himself charles  is that you charles  it can't be you because you're just a figment of my imagination aren't you charles well guess what  he gets knocked over and dragged across the floor  another lucky camera shot chick  hears things  try to communicate  and is standing there getting abrasions or something dude  he was in the attic  reached his arm through a hole in the floor and got a splinter  i don't remember what else dude  runs  gets chick hear chick and dude  screaming  they find them chained to a wall and strapped to a table  they leave  cut to black  final text tell us they escaped safely  were treated for minor cuts  they have since had nightmares and insomnia  we also find out the next day a call was made by they name a someone named charles'major spoilers' over okay  when i first heard this movie was being made  i couldn't wait  i thought it was going to be real  real  real   and more professional  with more professional type people  i love the idea of this type of thing  i'd love to see real haunting footage  before this movie was released i saw couple reviews of it by people online  they both claimed how fake it was and how stupid the people were  time passed i forgot about the film  then i realized it was never released at theaters  so i found out it went straight to video  rented it  found that every brutal review was completely true  it's too bad  i really wanted this to be good random thought  the house didn't seem to have tvs  radios  kitchen appliances that i recall  which would make me think no one has lived there for a long time  especially the house is truly known for being haunted  im pretty sure no one lives there  but it looks so clean and tidy  and what was a cat doing there  the property does not have near by

players or officials but one aspect of this you will prove to anyone it's not real in the way you were hoping for the dead rarely sounds like real natural talk but also down not sound to be scripted possibly being attached to me it sounded much more like they were always trying to adlib which they almost always did poorly therefore they knew they were making a 'movie' not just collecting real natural footage so i'm sure these men knew what was going on knew they had certain spots to look for things that were set up and they were just told to adlib around it all 'major spoilers' okay it's so different every item spot or thing that could be strange or use d as a spirit is magically stumbled upon by these people let me list off the ridiculously obviously faked things that happened that i remember less than minutes of entering the house they had a light switch on the roof sparks and a man almost falls on a guy they happen to know an old medical bag with a bloody butcher knife in it while exploring the cellar they hear a noise in an armoire so they open the door slowly approaches a cat happens to be in there and jumps straight at the camera while and then they happen to notice there is a hole in the wall so let's stick our hand in wow they pulled out a doll of a baby wrapped in mummy tape let's go to the attic uhoh it feels 'heavy' up here boom a chair flies across the room time to eat oh no the girl that was scared of bugs had a roach in her sandwich lol ridiculous let's get out the ouija board oops one of the legs on the planchette fell off the side of the board that couldn't be because the people were pushing it could it they find out a ghost there is named charles wait what was that noise in the chimney clink oh my shackles fell out i think she kept coming up here now wimpy girl is going to brave looking up the chimney shaft oh what's this she sees something and is asking people who aren't looking up the chimney what it is swish it falls off straight at her perfect camera as she moves just in time it was more chain now we have to separate and each 'cleanse' our designated rooms wouldn't it be something if things started happening one by two to these people now okay chick wow suddenly her room is shaking but no one elses does dude who says to himself charles is that you charles it can't be you because you're just a figment of my imagination aren't you charles well guess what he had knocked over and dragged across the floor another lucky camera shot chick hears things try to remember and is standing there getting abrasions or something dude he was in the morning reached his arm through a hole in the floor and got a splinter i don't remember what else dude runs gets chick hear chick and dude screaming they find them chained to a wall and strapped to a table they leave cut to black final text tell us they escaped safely were treated for minor cuts they have since had nightmares and insomnia we also find out the next day a call was made by they name a someone named charles'major spoilers' over okay when i first heard this movie was being something i couldn't wait i thought it was going to be real real real and more professional with more professional type people i love the idea of this type of thing i'd love to be real haunting footage before this movie was released i got couple reviews of it by people online they both claimed how fake it was and how stupid the people were time passed i forgot about the film then i realized it was never released at theaters so i found out it went straight to video rented it found that every brutal review was completely true it's too bad i really wanted this to be good random thought the house didn't seem to have two radios kitchen appliances that i recall which would make me think no one has lived there for a long time especially the house is truly known for being haunted im pretty sure no one lives there but it looks so neat and tidy and what was a cat doing there the property does not have near by neighbors allinall you'll only want to rent this if you and your friends wanna sit there and make fun of it or if you heard about it a long time ago and it intrigued you you will will

promotional talk  additionally there is a good music video tag team table match  bubby ray and spike dudley vs  eddie guerro and chris benoit  this was a pretty good intense match to start off the

quick though  wwe european championship  jeff hardy v  william regal  i've never really liked regal as a wrestler  he lacks intensity and style  hardy was impressive but really didn't get a chance to show off his high flying act  although he still performed some good counters and added that needed fast pace to the match  it ended off quickly which was perfect for this match  john cena v  chris jericho  it's funny looking back at cena's very first ppv  how he used to act  how he used to dress  and how he used to look watch his interview  it's pretty funny  this was a good intense match with cena showing a nice variety of holds  suplexes  counters and some aerial  jericho was subpar but definitely helped cena launch his career  cena wins wwe intercontenital championship  rvd v  brock

great in this match better than his later matches with edge and cenaand the entire match was fast pace  the ending worked perfectly because it still preserved brock's undefeated streak while giving rvd his just desserts in his home state no disqualification match  booker t v  big show  another solid match that lacked a certain intensity as the rvd match but still a good follow up  although it

movie starts with what can only be described as five minutes of scrolling text that may or may not be important  as after a minute passes  the audience stops caring and just sits through the rest

really can't follow with what is going on  characters move in and out of the plot like candy  some having huge buildups for meaningless deaths  basically  what i can understand is that some demons got released  and edward carnby  slater  has some link to them thanks to some operation given to children in his orphanage which has failed on him  he finds an artefact involving the demons and brings it to an exgirlfriend anthropologist  reid   who of course he manages to have sex with right away for no good reason  then  out of nowhere  all hell breaks loose  and the pair end up with a military team led by some asshole commander  dorff   who apparently has a mutual hatred for carnby it's all ridiculous  and the reason i don't really understand it isn't just because it's complicated and jumbled  but it leaves no room for anyone to really care  instead  i highly recommend that  if you must see this film  bring a tennis ball or something to occupy yourself when the plot manages to bore you into confusion the action scenes in a movie with a plot as terrible as this should at least bring it up a little  right  too bad  this movie is like any other ruined crap ever made  with enough quick cuts to behead a coop of chickens  considering that this is based on a horror game  not an action game  it is especially annoying the first action scene involving a man chasing cranby from a taxi is among the worst i have ever had to witness  and the rest isn't all that great either  the demons look somewhat cool  though the fact that they turn into powder when killed takes away all that effect  scenes involving lots of guns which should be cool to watch instead involve the muzzle fire as the only source of light and the camera zooming and panning faster than the head of a crack addict  it's all the kind of seizure inducing crap that keeps children in bed at night the acting is what i like to call taking actors and making them do nothing  slater does nothing but sound important for the whole movie  though he does seem to have more talent than he is letting on  the same is true of dorff  who gets a thankless role despite actually having some talent something that has happened to him a lot  reid is pretty much exactly what she should be  background sex appeal  as whenever she tries to act it is a disaster as is the incredibly bad scientist look she has in the beginning in all  this is the type of movie that worries me about future video game movies  if they keep ruining the spirit like this  it's only a matter of time before samus aran is killing middleeasterns with an ak and tommy

1,lately i have been watching a lot of tom hanks films and old chaplin films and even some of rowan atkinson's early bean performances  and it seems that all of them have their own unique charm that permeates throughout their work  something that allows them to identify with audience members of all ages  in a way that just makes you feel good  a bug's life has that same charm  it has a connection with real life that allows us to easily suspend disbelief and accept a lot of talking insects  because even though they talk  they still act just like real bugs  it's like the team that made the movie found a way to bring us into the mind of a child and allow us to think like them  to imagine bugs the way a young mind does honey  i shrunk the kids was one of my favorite films when i was younger  and to me  a bug's life is like a more realistic version of that movie  if only because the animation is so breathtaking and this style of storytelling just opens up so many more narrative possibilities  i try not to compare it to something like toy story which i still maintain is the best computer animated film ever made  because the story of a bug's life is not quite as good as toy story's  but then again  almost nothing is  the important thing is that it is still wonderful fun  the story concerns a colony of hard working bugs who have an impressively developed society  mostly geared around building a harvest of food  most of which will go to the tyrannical grasshoppers  vastly superior in strength and general meanness  and hopefully still leave enough left over for the bugs to make it through the winter  we are treated to some visits from the grasshoppers  who make it clear that if the bugs provide an unsatisfactory quantity of food  the consequences will be dire  and incidentally  the similarities between this crippling level of food extraction is strikingly similar to mao tsetung's vicious forcing of food from his own people during the great leap forward the fun and excitement begins when flik  the main character  sets off on a quest to find a gang of appropriate warrior bugs to come back and help defend the colony against the grasshoppers  you see  he spilled all of the amassed food and placed everyone in great danger  so he feels it's his responsibility  but he inadvertently ends up hiring a struggling group of insect circus performers  great for the audience  not so great for the safety of the clan  the movie was released back in the late s  when so many films seemed to have been coming out in twos  like armageddon and deep impact  independence day and the arrival  a bug's life and antz  etc  comparisons between a bug's life and antz are inevitable  although it seems clear to me that a bug's life is by far the superior film  and not only because it doesn't star woody allen stuttering and whining through the lead role  this is great family fun ,0.9934870004653932,0,lately i have been watching a lot of tom hanks young and old

low meanness and arrogance would not enough left over for the bugs to make it through the winter we are going to some visits from the grasshoppers who make it clear that if the bugs provide an unsatisfactory quantity of consequences the consequences will be dire and incidentally the similarities between this crippling level of food extraction is strikingly close to mao tsetung's vicious forcing of food from his own people during the great leap forward the fun and excitement begins when flik the main character takes off on a quest to find a list of appropriate warrior bugs to come back and help defend the colony against the grasshoppers you see he spilled all of the amassed food and placed everyone in great danger so he feels it's his responsibility but he inadvertently ends up hiring a struggling group of insect circus performers great for the world not so much for the safety of the clan the movie was released back in the late s when so many films seemed to have been coming out in twos of armageddon and deep impact independence canada and the arrival a bug's life and antz etc comparisons between a bug's life and antz are inevitable although it seems clear to me that a bug's life is by far the superior film and not only because it doesn't star paul was stuttering and whining through the leadership role this is great family

1,this movie was an impressive one  my first experience with a foreign film  it was neither too long  nor too complex  i myself enjoyed the subtitles  and the plot was surprisingly fresh  the story of an adult son visiting his elderly father and retarded brother after a long separation appeared cliched at first  but it proved to be very touching and realistic  there was also some subtle humor so as not to depress or bore the audience ,0.984449565410614,0,this movie was an odd one my first experience with a foreign film it was neither too long nor too complex i myself used the subtitles and the plot was surprisingly not the name of an unnamed son visiting his elderly wife and retarded brother after a lengthy list appeared cliched at all but it proved to be very careful and realistic there was even some subtle did so as not to depress or bore the audience,0.08510108292102814,12,0.8669833729216152,Y,0.15584415584415584
0,you know  i really have a problem with movie lists  i was reading maxim magazine a while ago and they had a list of the greatest bmovies of all time  and knowing me  i of course have to go through and watch them all and write reviews of all of them  this is why you see reviews of movies like gator bait and barb wire and coffy on my list  so i noticed h o t s  at the video store the other day and recognized it from maxim's list of the greatest bmovies  and i decided to rent it and check it out  my only consolation is that i rented it because i recognized it from a list of bmovies  so i already knew it was going to suck  given the type of movie that it is  i can't say that h o t s  is a total failure  since it is nothing more than a late s t film  and it never pretends to by anything else  the only place where it strays widely from its objective is in a ragged subplot involving a couple of excons who have stashed a lot of stolen money in the house that the selfnamed h o t s  move in to  because this subplot has absolutely no place in the movie  despite the fact that the rest of the movie is as well  this subplot is completely superfluous and unnecessary  the story is based on a couple of rival sororities at the beloved f u  which exists as one of those universities that contains a grand total of one sorority until the rejects form their own in order to get back at the snobs in the other one  this new sorority  help out the seals h o t s   is a sorority supposedly based on helping seals the seal subplot is another one that doesn't really belong in the movie  and little attention is paid to the meaning of that name beyond having a seal running around here and there throughout the movie  this is going to sound weird  but there was actually one scene that i was pretty impressed with in this movie  one shot that i was impressed with  i should say  about midway through the movie  one of the girls in pi  the rival sorority  is pouring alcohol into the punch  and she pours some for herself in a glass and drinks it  oddly enough  what she does as she drinks that alcohol reminds me of something that charlie chaplin would do  which really brightened up the movie  obviously  nothing in this movie comes close to anything that chaplin ever did  but that shot alone raised my score for the movie from a to a as a whole  however  the movie is exactly what you would expect it to be  a lot of people running around looking for excuses to take off their clothes i liked how the removeonepieceofclothingforeveryscore in the football game at the end was one of the girls' ideas  riiiiiiiiight   and not much thought is put into much of anything else  there is  for example  a scene early in the film when a couple of the pi girls pour hot sauce into the refreshments at a h o t s  party  accidentally getting caught in an incriminating photograph the girl taking the picture didn't realize that she photographed them at the time  although the photograph never comes up for any reason later in the film  i've seen movies like this before  it's kind of like gator bait but without the violence and the rednecks and coffy wasn't far off  even barb wire is much the same  just with a bigger budget and more silicon  thankfully  maxim's bmovie list contains only a few more comedies  because while these cheesy teen t films are entertaining every once in a while as bad movies with the occasional seminude scene  after watching h o t s  i think i've decided that i like the bad horror movies better than the bad comedies  i'd rather watch a lot of terrible

0,i hate plane crash movies  all of them  in fact  i hate them all with a passion  first of all  they are cheaplooking and have no craftsmanship  secondly  they insult the airline industry and say to the audience that all planes do is  fall out of the sky and crash why i wince at such a film  this could happen to any of us and with worser consequences than those suffered by the characters in said movie  which is the only chilling aspect of an airline disaster yarn such as this  i hate this movie because it's like all the stupidass airplane chaos movies before it  freefall is like all the others  nothing more than boredom before the clich√©d bullshit dramatic scenes take place  first  off we have same cast of retards on this flying death trap  the cleaveresquire family of three  the yuppie baastard  and the bitch of a flight attendant complete with a big blond hairdo from scolding anyone who is the least bit frightened  my second gripe is this shouldn't be a fulllength movie  but a documentary explaining everything about the air canada gimbli glider incident a k a freefall right down to the safety precautions my third and final gripe is with all airline films of this caliberwith the exception of fearless why the hell did the male steward instruct the passengers to remove there shoes  i could understand high heels and sharp  loose objects  but c'mon like that's gonna' make them any more fking safer than they are now  this plane if theythe passengers didn't know any better  knew they were going to crash land  why would you force injured people down a rubber slide that can cause skin to peel and bleed on impact only to walk in their stocking feet on a debris field  does this make any sense to anyone fearless and the hit abc series lost had more depth and realism to air disaster than just plane malfunctionspeople panicstewards become assholesplane lands without wheels in a fieldpeople wander without shoes and jackets  etc  the same old crap from airport  freefall was so typical of a aircrash movie that i almost expect to see either charlton heston or peter graves burst into the damn passenger cabin at any moment  could we at least see how these poorlyacted characters go back to normalcy instead of people rejoicing amidst the impending tragedy that is staring in front of them  typical moronic lifetime movie  cheap and stupid  the director of freefall should stick to cheap madefortv movies with white middleaged women with stupid teenage kids who do drugs and have marital problems  as for suspense  leave it to the professionals  you hack  why should we the audience sit through over an hour and a half of this airport wannabe rehash  i hope to god they don't make plane crash movies like this anymore  if this were like the abc series lost then it would be something to watch  but this is utter crap and then some  stop turning every plane disaster movie into airport  this is not airport this is cheap pathetic waste of my time  i would not recommend this movie or any madefortv air disaster movie to anyone not even my worst enemies ,0.014354735612869263,1,i hate plane crash killed all of them in fact i loved them all with a

at such a film this could happen to any of us and with worser consequences than those suffered by the characters in said movie which is the only chilling aspect of an airline pilot yarn such as this i love this movie because it's like all the stupidass airplane chaos movies before it freefall is like all the others nothing more than boredom before the clich√©d bullshit dramatic performances take place first off we have same cast of retards on this flying death and the cleaveresquire family of three the great baastard and the bitch of a flight attendant complete with a big blond hairdo from scolding anyone who is the least bit frightened my second thought is this shouldn't be a fulllength movie but a story explaining everything about the air canada gimbli glider incident a k a freefall right down to the safety precautions my third and fourth gripe is with all airline films of this caliberwith the exception of fearless why the hell did the male steward instruct the passengers to remove there shoes i could understand high heels and others loose objects but c'mon if that's gonna' make them any more the safer than they are now this plane if theythe passengers didn't sound any better knew they were going to crash land why would you force injured people down a rubber slide that can cause skin to skin and bleed on impact only to walk in their bare skin on a debris field does this make any sense to anyone fearless and the hit abc series lost had more depth and realism to air disaster than just plane malfunctionspeople panicstewards become assholesplane lands without wheels in a fieldpeople wander without shoes and jackets etc the same old crap from airport freefall was so typical of a aircrash movie that i almost expect to see either charlton heston or peter graves burst into the damn passenger cabin at any moment could we at least see how these poorlyacted characters dating back to normalcy instead of people rejoicing about the impending tragedy that is staring in front of them typical moronic horror movie cheap and stupid the director of freefall should stick to cheap madefortv movies with white middleaged women with stupid teenage kids who do drugs and have marital problems as for suspense leave it to the professionals you hack why should we the audience sit through over an hour and a half of this airport wannabe rehash i hope to god they don't know plane crash movies like this anymore if this were like the abc series lost then it would be something to say but this is utter crap and then some stop turning every plane disaster movie into airport this is not airport this is a pathetic waste of my time i would not recommend this movie or any madefortv air disaster movie to anyone not even my worst

1,daisy movie review by james mudge from beyondhollywood comon paper  daisy sounds like an asian film fan's dream come true  directed by infernal affairs cohelmer andrew lau and starring everybody's favourite sassy girl  popular korean actress jeon ji hyun  unfortunately  despite the talent involved  and the fact that the crew flew halfway around the world to shoot in amsterdam  the film turns out to be a bit of a disappointment  being a clich'd romantic drama which wallows in misery and self importance the plot follows hye young jeon ji hyun  a rather naive korean girl who lives in amsterdam  spending her life working in her grandfather's antique shop and doing portraits for tourists  one day  she begins receiving flowers at exactly the same time from a secret admirer  who she believes to be a mystery man from her past who once built her a nice little bridge  one day she meets jeong woo lee seong jae  also in holiday and public enemy  who unbeknownst to her is actually an interpol agent tracking asian criminals in the netherlands with hye young assuming that jeong woo is responsible for the flowers  the two fall very slowly into a chaste romantic relationship  however  it turns out that the man sending the flowers is actually park yi jung woo sung  from sad movie and musa  an assassin working for a chinese crime syndicate  inevitably  the love triangle turns tragic and the two men end up facing off while poor hye young tries to work out which of the two is the love of her life although daisy is ostensibly a love story  it has the feel of a funeral  with a slow  sombre pace and a plot which piles on the misery  half of the film's running time is taken up with scenes of the characters staring longingly out of windows into the rain  with the silence broken only by bouts of self pitying narration  director lau seems to be under the impression that the film is a weighty shakespearean tragedy  rather than yet another gloomy hitman love story  as such  the proceedings have a rather pretentious air  despite the fact that the plot is inherently predictable and based largely around glaring clich√© borrowed liberally from the likes of fulltime killer and john woo's classic the killeralmost every aspect of the film is riddled with angst  with the three lead characters suffering as if the weight of the world was on their shoulders  and steadfastly refusing to do anything to pursue their romantic inclinations  park yi in particular  as the kind of overly emotional  socially retarded assassin so beloved of modern cinema  is faintly ludicrous  from his blatant incompetence on the job to his hilarious attempts to discuss impressionist painting with hye young or his penchant for flower growing  this languid passivity does make the film's central romance somewhat hard to swallow  and lau's attempts to evoke the feeling that it is fate which brings the characters together comes across more as shoddy coincidence fans of jeon ji hyun should note that her character is far closer to her role in the glum supernatural drama the uninvited than my sassy girl or windstruck and while she tries her best to pull a few wacky faces here and there  her performance is certainly more subdued the film benefits from glossy production values  and lau makes good use of the amsterdam scenery  playing on the contrast between the grey  almost gothic beauty of the city and the innocent blue skies and flowery fields of the countryside  unfortunately  he tends to overuse slow motion for some of the emotional scenes  which when coupled with some of the picture postcard visuals gives the film the feel at times of a perfume advert  there are a few scenes of surprisingly violent action  though these are few and far between  and whilst well staged  seem to have been thrown in as an afterthought and do little more than briefly raising the pulse despite its flaws  daisy makes for engaging viewing  and the story grips almost in spite of itself  mainly out of a morbid fascination to see not which of the men hye young will end up with  but to see who will lie dying in her arms  the self indulgent melodrama works well enough to tick all the right boxes for the genre  and the film functions perfectly well as an enjoyably glossy  weepy romance it is worth noting that the dvd features the director's cut of the film  which for once indicates that it is substantially different from the theatrical version  which not only adds minutes  but reorders some of the scenes  making the narrative less linear  although this new version is perhaps too long  it is surely superior  as without these changes  the film would surely have been even more conventional and would have suffered from even murkier character development wai keung lau

obsessed with bats and insists they go to a nearby cave  once there  they behave very  very  very stupidly hallmark of a bad film and are soon bitten by a bat  according to this film  bats love to attack people and there are vampire bats in the usboth of which are not true at all oddly  after being bitten  the man doesn't even bother going to the hospital  the first thing on anyone's mind especially a doctor is to get medical help immediately  but not this boob  soon  he's having seizuresyet he still isn't interested in seeking help  again and again you keep thinking that this must be the stupidest couple in film history  after a while  he eventually goes to see a doctor and is sent to the hospital  but  by then it's too late and his attacks become more violent and he begins killing people to suck their blood  when it's totally obvious to everyone that the man is a crazed killing machine  the wife who  like her husband  has a grapefruit for a brain refuses to believe he's dangerouseven after he attacks people  steals an ambulance and runs a police car off the road  now most of the time moss is going through these episodes  his eyes roll back and he looks like a normal person  oddly  however  a couple times he develops batlike hands and towards the end they used some nice prosthetics on him to make him look quite batlike  had this been really cheesy  the film would have merited a in the very end  in a twist that hardly made any sense at all  the wife inexplicably turned into a crazed bat lady and had a swarm of bats kill the evil sheriff  how all this was arranged was a mystery as was moss' and mcandrew's belief that this film would somehow help their careersthough they both have had reasonably long careers on tv playing bit roles since overall  very dumb  the plot is silly and makes no sense and strongly relies on people acting way too dumb to be real  not a good film at all  but not among the worst films of all time either note  for some reason

longlost cousin  unfortunately  whitaker decided to stay one more year  and thus williams was written out of the series when he moved away to marry adam's old girlfriend  if williams had stayed on for

or two they also had ben take in some other lost cousin jamie  played by the forgettable mitch vogel who was a teenager that was usually getting into some kind of trouble with someone apparently by adding the teenager  the studio was looking to attract younger viewers  it also gave the writers a chance to write episodes about teenage problems  alcohol  delinquency  etc  those kind of preachy

0,all right  let's be realistic about this  nobody goes into a movie produced by wwe films whose owner has challenged god to a wrestling match  directed by a former porn director the man gave the world the between the cheeks trilogy  starring a wrestler named kane  and expects a little slice of art on a golden platter  if you do then you probably need to find something other than watching movies to occupy your time so what exactly are we to expect from a movie like this  well  here's what i was looking forward to  bad acting   a fairly nonexistent  clich√©d storyline   kane walking around with a scrunched  sour face that indicates his nostrils just found the potato salad he misplaced a month ago   tons and tons of gore  well  if you're hungry for some so bad it's funny entertainment then this might satisfy your appetite because it delivers on all counts obviously  movies like this are best seen for free  but if you do choose to sacrifice box office bucks then have some fun and make a game out of it  the filmmakers are nice enough to introduce us to each of the annoying delinquents by flashing their names and legal offenses on the screen  this makes it easier for you to write down which ones you want to see killed and in what order  you and your friends can see whose predictions are most accurate i also suggest that you and your pals write down every single moment of stupidity and inanity that you can find  tally them up at the end and see who comes up with the most  i think my grand total was  can you beat that  i personally want to know how after years and a fire does this abandoned hotel still have electricity  running water  and a working elevator i know  i know  the filmmakers are assuming that if you pay to see this then you obviously don't put much thought into what you spend your money on and therefore likely won't put much thought into how silly the movie is  but that doesn't mean we can't point it out and laugh at it i also like how the city wants to turn this huge hotel which would be condemned and recommended for demolition by any sensible inspector into a homeless shelter and they think the best way to get it cleaned up is to give eight punks a few mops and brooms  uhhuh i think you pretty much know what to expect  but i feel the need to provide you with a couple of warnings  first  if you hate crowd interaction no matter the movie then you might want to stay away  the people in the audience acted like they were at an actual wrestling show  shouts of kill him  kane  and i hope you die first  and chokeslam  echoed through the theater  showcasing what i hope is not the best of what america has to offer  i usually don't appreciate such audience interaction  but for a cheesefest like this i thought the commentary added to the entertainment value  however  i can see how others could be annoyed by it second  and this shouldn't even warrant explanation  the film doesn't shy away from the gore  if watching a big ugly dude rip eyeballs right out of their sockets doesn't scream fun night at the movies  for ya then you know good and well to save your dough i must say that i was a little surprised by the extreme lack of dialogue on kane's part  i wasn't expecting him to put on an acting clinic  but i was hoping he'd have some cute little catchphrase like say goodnight his character's last name is goodnight right before he killed a victim  instead he uttered four words in the entire film  no  and i see it  but hey  he delivered them flawlessly if i were a bad guy in a movie then my catchphrase would be something like place your betts  or all betts are off  it'd rule and you know it  we need a new genre term for bad horror films like see no evil that induce so much unintentional laughter that you almost have to label them comedic  feel free to send me your suggestions  for now we'll just call 'em horlarious ,0.05625738948583603,1,all right let's be realistic about this nobody

0,disney has now made straighttovideo sequels to a good bunch of their many animated features  two of these were made for their classic  beauty and the beast well  these ones aren't really sequels  as they are both set in between the events of the first film  the first of these two straighttovideo films was beauty and the beast  the enchanted christmas which seems to be disliked by quite a few fans of its theatrical predecessor  but i think that can usually be expected with sequels  however  this second one  belle's magical world is definitely inferior the film features three short stories  all of which take place while belle is in the castle  and the place is under the spell of the enchantress  the first is the perfect word where a misunderstanding at the table between belle and the beast leads to trouble  and neither wants to be the first to apologize  the next story is fifi's folly where fifi and lumiere's fifth anniversary is coming up  and lumiere is unprepared  so belle helps him  however  fifi sees lumiere practicing romance with belle  and thinks they're actually in love  the film ends with the broken wing in this story  belle takes care of a bird with a broken wing  but a bird in the castle will probably mean trouble if the beast finds out  as he hates birds  the plot description i gave is for the original vhs version of disney's third beauty and the beast movie  apparently  in the dvd version  there is another story added called mrs  potts's party but i've only seen the original version  however  since i highly doubt that one story would stand out as a classic over the rest  i see no point in watching the special edition  anyway  the first thing i will say about belle's magical world is that the animation is very dimensional compared to what we're used to from disney  which would obviously disappoint many people  i didn't like beauty and the beast  the enchanted christmas that much  but you certainly can't say the same about its animation  i'm sure the stories in belle's magical world could entertain many kids mostly younger ones  i think  and each story has a moral  so they could also teach them some valuable lessons  however  for adults  the film really doesn't have a lot  i personally didn't find any good humour in it  found that the constant conflict between belle and the beast got tiring  and the stories did not impress me too much at all in any way they're not very well written  in the perfect word the way belle says to the beast  you're acting rude  and foolish  is a bit cheesy  and i think there are quite a few other cheesy moments in these stories by the time this straighttovideo movie first came out  i was around eleven or twelve years old  i don't know what i would have thought of it at the time  as i had lost interest in disney by then  and it would be years before i would gain any of that interest back  even when this movie was first released  i think i was a bit past the age group it was aimed at  i never saw beauty and the beast  the enchanted christmas until a couple months ago  but unlike that film  i never even heard of this one until recently  i think just after seeing the first sequel to disney's hit  well  as much as i like the theatrical original  i wouldn't have been missing much if i never became aware of this film's existence  for little kids  i'm sure belle's magical world can be highly entertaining  and probably somewhat educational with its morals  but i do not recommend it for adult disney fans ,0.20699873566627505,1,disney has now made straighttovideo down to a good

tell someone when they are doing a good job or a bad job in a scene  this is a blatant lie  the script appears to have been written by an yearold  who decided to include a scene of someone throwing up on a girl's chest and to include the hilarious line  it smells like someone farted out here  the characters have no personality or depth and they do some of the most moronic things ever seen in a horror movie  somewhere along the way  the characters also magically transform into a swat team to take down the zombies  it's like they don't even have to aim their guns and they automatically shoot the zombies in the head the scariest thing by far about this movie is the directing  there is something wrong with uwe boll  boll's camera work is astonishingly disjointed  his pans to zombies running through the forest are more silly than menacing  worse yet  boll actually thought it would be a good idea to include small bits of footage from the house of the dead video game into the movie  quite often  and at the most random times  you will suddenly see an animated zombie getting shot  it makes no sense  no one in their right mind would think that was a good idea  it's like boll wants to remind us repeatedly that this movie is supposed to be based on the video game  uwe boll also decided it would be cool to include slow motion degree rotating shots during the action scenes  a la 'the matrix' unfortunately  he does it way too often and each shot is nauseating  the soundtrack to this movie also boggles the mind  most action scenes are accompanied by loud rap track  this also adds to the ensuing headaches caused by the atrocious 'house of the dead''house of the dead' isn't bad because it's based on a video game  in fact  it has very little to do with the video game  it also does not fit into the category of 'so bad that it's good' it does however fit into the category of 'so bad that it's painful' this movie just plain sucks  uwe boll should never be let anywhere near another

1,i've read innumerable reviews talking about the superiority of the miniseries  i certainly can't agree on such a blanket statement  if you analyze all of the aspects of a video  film production  there are numerable areas where the film is arguably vastly superior certainly  many of the comments are valid with regard to particular areas of the miniseries  specifically regarding more threads customs officers and more developed threads such as the pakistani farmer and family  that said  i found catherine zetajones' character much more compelling as the desperate women  from poverty to riches who won't go back  that's a much more likable character than this cold women who didn't seem to have as much reason for her quick turn to evil  and yes  i understand  her children  she was desperate  i just didn't see her as being as desperate further  while i appreciated some of the more fleshed out story threads in the miniseries  benicio del toro's character was very compelling  an anchor for the film  that thread was changed as an alternative to the pakistani family in nothing but good ways  a fantastic adaptation  of course  i'm skeptical that someone so pure can exist within such a system  but i don't know enough about the politics of the nation to argue after watching the first episode of the miniseries  i actually rewatched the film  why  i kept reading about the fantastic acting  i found the performances in the first episode of the miniseries to be borderline laughable  certainly  this improved as the miniseries progressed  now having just finished both versions in a few days  i can't agree that the performances in the miniseries reached the same level as  say  benicio del toro  who was brilliant in the film  though ormand  paterson  shah  and

,0.8694297075271606,0,i've read innumerable reviews talking about the superiority of the miniseries i certainly can't agree on such a blanket statement if you analyze all of the aspects of a video film production there are numerable areas where the film is arguably vastly superior certainly thought of the comments are valid with exception to particular areas of the miniseries specifically regarding more threads for officers and more developed economies such as the pakistani farmer and family that said i found catherine zetajones' character much more so as the desperate women from poverty to riches who won't go back that's a much more likable character than this cold women who didn't seem to have as much reason for her quick turn to evil and yes i understand her children she was desperate i just didn't see her as being as desperate further while i ate some of the more fleshed out story threads in the miniseries benicio del toro's character was very likely an anchor for the film that thread was changed as an alternative to the pakistani family in nothing but good ways a fantastic adaptation of course i'm skeptical that someone so pure can exist within such a system but i don't know enough about the politics of the nation to argue after watching the first episode of the miniseries i actually rewatched the film why i kept reading about the fantastic acting i found the performances in the first episode of the miniseries to be borderline laughable but this improved as the miniseries progressed now having just finished both versions in a few days i can't agree that the performances in the miniseries reached the same problem as say benicio del toro who was that in the film de ormand paterson shah and lindsay duncan were very good i also feel the police in

0,i have just given a for thieves highway  i mention this for two reasons one to prove i'm not a git who only gives bad reviews but because the theme of the film has the same thread namely the falling in love with a woman of the night we all know pretty woman is a chick flick but you can't avoid them all  they'll eventually get you  pretty woman for me does two things  two terrible horrible ghastly things  firstly it portrays prostitution as a career more akin to that of a dancer  you know with absolutely great friends  leg warmers lots of giggling  borrowing each others make up  you see in the reality of pretty woman the prostitute and this is a street walker prostitute we're talking about here  has a great life  she's healthy happy with only the occasional whimper to explain her predicament  my feeling is this 'happy hooker' type protagonist is a lot more palatable than an even nearly realistic character  which for me begs the question if you make a movie about a type of person but are too chicken scared to adorn that player with the characteristics familiar to that role then why do it  if i make a film about a chef but don't want him to cook or talk about food or wear a white hat then why make a film about a chef in the first place  by bailing out and turning the hooker into a respectable dancer type the story misses the point completely and consequently never indulges in any of the moral or social questions that it could have  what a cop out  really really lame  secondly  'pretty woman' insults romance itself  edward lewis played by richard gere has no clue how to seduce or romance this 'lady' that is without his plastic friend  yep don't leave home without it  especially if you are a moron in a suit who has no imagination  out of of his romantic moments involve splashing cash in one way or another  even when he first meets her it's the lotus esprit turbo that does all the work  necklaces here diamonds there limos over there  money money money  where's the charm  where's the charisma  don't mention that attempt at the piano please girls who like this film will also be girls who like shopping more than most  guys who like this film will not even have realized that old eddy has less charm than a calculator  as they probably don't either so it wont have registered  more importantly anyone who likes this film will hate 'thieves highway' a wonderful story of which part is based on the same subject i'll finish on a songretty woman hangin round the street pretty woman  the kind i like to treat pretty woman  i don't believe you you're not

you  i'll treat you right,0.03772751241922378,1,i have just given a for thieves highway i mention this for two reasons one to prove i'm not a git who only gives bad results but because the theme of the film has the same thread on the falling in love with a woman of the world we all love pretty woman is a comedy flick but you can't avoid them all they'll eventually get you pretty woman for me does two things they were more ghastly things firstly it portrays prostitution as a career more akin to that of a dancer you know with absolutely great friends leg warmers lots of giggling borrowing each others make up you see in the reality of pretty woman the prostitute and this is a road walker prostitute we're talking about here has a great life she's healthy happy with only the occasional whimper to escape her predicament my feeling is this 'happy hooker' type protagonist is a lot more palatable than an even nearly realistic character which for me begs the heavens if you make a movie about a type of person but are too chicken scared to adorn that player with the characteristics familiar to that role then why do it if i make a film about a chef but don't want him to cook or talk about food or wear a white hat then why make a fuss about a chef in the first place by time out and turning the hooker into a respectable dancer type the story misses the point completely and consequently never appeared in any of the moral or social questions that it could have what a cop out really really and secondly 'pretty woman' and romance itself edward lewis played by richard gere has no clue how to seduce or romance this 'lady' that is not his plastic friend yep don't leave home without it especially if you are a moron in a suit who has no imagination out of of his romantic moments involve the cash in one way or another even when he first meets her it's the lotus esprit turbo that does all the work is here or there limos over there money money money where's the girl where's the charisma don't mention that attempt at the piano please girls who like this film will also be girls who like shopping more than most guys who like this film will not even have realized that old eddy has less charm than a calculator as they probably don't either so it wont have registered more importantly anyone who likes this film will hate 'thieves highway' a wonderful story of which part is based on the same subject i'll finish on a songretty is hangin round the street pretty woman the kind i like to treat pretty woman i don't believe you you're not the truth no one could

0,i remember seeing the very first trailer for underdog back last march  i also remember at the time smiling to myself ever so slightly  sure it was a cheesy idea  but i genuinely thought at the time the concept might work  hell it couldn't be any worse than the disappointing cats and dogs could it  then by december and i suddenly remembered the film i realised how likely the film was to suck  the fact it had been delayed in the uk made it seem inevitable it would be terrible  but the horrendous reviews just made me realise it was nigh on impossible for the movie to be any good  still i swallowed my feelings and went to see the film with a friend today  as i entered my screen i was mortified  it was the very first time i'd be seeing a movie with a friend and being the only two in the screen  little did i know for what i was about to endure  underdog to put it blunt is horrendous  it really is  imagine how bad you could think this movie is and then prepare yourself for a movie even worse  that is just how pathetic the movie is  while it aims to entertain kids it just seems an embarrassing mess that seems to insult kids rather than allow them to enjoy the movie  matters cannot be helped by the fact that the story is beyond lacklustre  the acting is generally poor  and the movie just feels like an overlong  tired and downright boring saturday cartoon  after a brief five minutes where i thought the movie might be passable the movie just suddenly seems to die and then limp on towards the already sign posted finale  i'm just amazed the movie was actually ever released  it's an embarrassment to disney  hell half their straight to video sequels are better than this  what's even more terrifying is the fact the ending leaves room for a sequel so lets get onto the acting cracks knuckles  okay let me be honest jason lee is decent  his voice suits the canine  and had he have been given a decent script he might have made the performance work  however  with such a dodgy script he just seems to flounder  in many ways it reminded me of bill murray in garfield  murray did what he could with what he had  but what he had wasn't enough to make it passable  then we get onto the human actors  and well the majority of atrocious  alex neuberger plays the friend of underdog  jack  my biggest concern is that anybody would even take him seriously in an audition  the scene where he gets to fly with underdog is perhaps the most cringe worthy scene in the past few years just because his acting is so poor  not once did i believe he was a real person  in fact part of me is still convinced he was a robot made specially for the movie  james belushi seems half dead in the film  he has nothing to work with  no decent lines  he just seems to wander around the set waiting to become relevant to the plot  which the writers try to do towards the end but do it in such a poor way its laughable  thankfully peter dinklage is the one redeeming factor of the movie  he is great as dr barsinister and seems to be having a laugh in the role  he steals every scene he is in  although that's hardly difficult when he shares screen time with the extremely annoying patrick warburton  the rest of the cast are even worse  especially taylor momsen  she just needs to end her acting career right now underdog also fails dramatically in terms of delivering anything like a funny scene  when the funniest scene involves underdog biting a can and causing dog food to explode everywhere you know there is something drastically wrong  this could be easily ignored if the movie had decent action or a good story  alas the movie is even worse in both of these terms  the effects are so ropey that any scene where underdog flies just seems absurd  and the dog uses his powers to such little effect that you frequently forget he has superpowers  what's the point in making a film about a super dog if the damned dog never appears super  the final fight also verges on embarrassing purely because its ten minutes of nothingness  the dog flies  other stuff happens  some stuff gets chucked about  all of this is irrelevant as this stuff is happening for the sake of stuff happening  the script as well is dodgy at best and downright pain inducingly awful at worst  when someone says look its a plane  no its a bird  no its a frog   yes you read that right  i just wanted to burst into tears there and then  actually i wanted to walk out by remained compelled to see whether it could get any lower than that point  this happens near the end so it doesn't thankfully overall underdog becomes the worst movie of at this early period  and is actually just as bad as last years epic movie  luckily for underdog  meet the spartans arrives over here soon and i expect that to be even worse  so in case you didn't get the point of my review  avoid the film at all costs  if you want to see a movie with a dog then watch cats and dogs  buy a real dog if necessary  just do not see this

try to figure out what they've got on they're hands when some of the team go missing  morton calls in security guy ammon navid negahban to handle the situation  meanwhile ancient text translator the rabbi eli schmidtt tom bosley translates some ancient text as he would  is shocked to learn of a evil prophecy in which these giants will rise up  take over the world for the fallen one  or something like that  it's up to matt to save the day  the whole planet  written  directed by kevin vanhook  who also has a small role in the film as the ancient warrior leader at the start  i personally thought the fallen ones was a terrible film  it's as simple  straight forward as that  there are so many things that are just plain bad about the fallen ones both on a technical  conceptual level  the script

friends with comedian matt and casper du dien in the desert discovering the mummified remains of a foot tall giant now there's something you don't see everyday matt is working for property developer morton robert wagner who wants to build a holiday show on the land he calls in fellow archaeologist was kristen miller for reasons i'm unsure of anyway they both try to figure out what they've got on they're hands when some of the team go missing morton calls in security guy ammon navid negahban to handle the situation on ancient russian translator the rabbi eli schmidtt tom bosley translates some ancient text as he would is shocked to learn of a evil prophecy in which these giants will rise up take over the world for the fallen one or something like that it's up to matt to save the world the whole work is directed by kevin vanhook who also has a small role in the film as the ancient tribal leader at the start i personally thought the little ones was a terrible film it's as simple straight forward as that there are so few things that are just plain bad about the fallen ones both on a broader conceptual level the system doesn't make a whole lot of sense it doesn't really get going until the final two minutes by which time i had finally lost the will to live the character's are portrayed as clich√©d as you like the dialogue is simple as in very very well the entire world is what i mean it's not going to come as a surprise that casper van dien is going to see the baby is it it's not a huge surprise that the mummified one is yet to come back to life either so why wait until over an hour into the film when most of the three will be in some sort of comatose state this is bad very bad you have been told that vanhook doesn't impress the final scenes are absolutely awful why is

lola  neither joe nor brooklyn figure on the interruption of little navymad donald dean stockwell and his aunt susie kathryn grayson  unexperienced in the ways of females and courting  brooklyn quickly enlists joe to help him win aunt susie over  along the way  however  joe finds himself falling for the gal he thinks belongs to his best friend  how is brooklyn going to take this betrayal  and does joe end up with susie  who loves him too the first and second times i saw anchors aweigh  i also saw it at the same time as i did on the town  the kelly  sinatra collaboration from both times i felt that anchors aweigh was the better film in terms of plotting and structureall the dances and songs fit the moment in the plot  and they develop the characters and story rather than hamper them  yet  both times i came away feeling that on the town is the better film overall  having now seen both films a third time  i still stand by that judgement  somehow on the town  as a film and a piece of entertainment  is just lighter  gayer  purely and simply happier the numbers are more outrageous and less integral to the plot  and yet somehow it works better than all the dances and singing in anchors aweigh  i'm not quite sure why this is  the typical argument is that the latter film is overlong  at almost two and a half hours  this is certainly a valid criticism to make  i certainly felt the length the first two times i saw it  however  it's also a film that grows on youthe more you see it  the shorter it feels and the more you appreciate the technical mastery involved in its making  and yet  something just doesn't hang together quite right  it feels almost as if the script was pored over  and every single moment when kelly could break into dance or sinatra into song was noted  and that's exactly what happened  no opportunity to shoehorn a musical number in was given up  and that's probably the film's biggest weakness  it has numbers give or take a few  and no matter how big a fan you are of kelly or sinatra  this really starts to turn one numb after a while  contrast this  for example  with the ten numbers in on the town  you might well feel that each song  each dance  can't be taken out of the film without leaving it lacking  and that's true  but that's also because the writers weren't more restrained in adding them in in the first place all this long preamble doesn't mean there's nothing good about anchors aweigh  the musical is splashy with great songs bursting out all over  like the duets between kelly and sinatra 'we hate to leave' 'i begged her' and 'if you knew susie'  the singing of sinatra 'what makes the sunset' 'the charm of you' and the best of all  'i fall in love too easily'  and without a doubt the always inventive  always breathtaking dancing of kelly  it's also hard to miss with a cast of this calibre  grayson is sweet and seems to improve on each viewing her voice becoming stunning rather than frightening jose iturbi's role is written sympathetically and he does a great job with it  even clarence's own brooklyn  pamela britton  is cute and charming  as close as one could get to betty garrett without being garrett herself  sinatra is adorable with those blue eyes and curls of his  and plays the innocent boyman wonderfully a role he reprises in on the town  his singing is  as usual  simply faultless from enunciation through to timing and phrasing  his solo numbers might seem to drag a little  but when you've got the voice of a century  showcasing it is probably as good a reason as any to slow up the rest of the film gene kelly's sheer genius in this film is worthy of its own paragraph  third in the billing behind sinatra and grayson respectively  anchors aweigh really is kelly's film  his joe brady is a believable  real characterhe's tough on the outside  glib and willing to lie when necessary to win a gal  but he's actually the biggest softy on the inside  kelly makes this charming rather than cloying  but also gives joe a real edge that you see in the scene when joe chases brooklyn around the room with a genuinely murderous look on his face and his breakfast tray in his hands  and the dancingagain  the film suffers from the 'too much of a good thing spoils the effect' syndrome  as it does with sinatra's singing  but once again  if it's gene kelly doing the softshoe  or tapping across the screen in a sailor's outfit or dressed up as a bandit chief  might as well err on the side of overdoing it  all of kelly's dances are breathtaking  be it the pareddown simplicity of his tap number with sinatra to 'i begged her' his 'mexican hat dance' with the sweet wideeyed little girl  or his lavish spanishinfluenced dance 'la cumparsita' of course  the classic image left in audiences' minds for all time would be kelly in his red  white and blue sailor suit  dancing with jerry mouse of 'tom  jerry' fame  a welldeserved golden film memory  to be sureit's not often that one can say you're impressed by the special effects in a film made in given the saturation of cgi in the contemporary film market  but gene and jerry still look great  with kelly always hitting his spots and looking exactly where he needs to look  it would turn out that just about the only people who could really keep up with gene kelly would be kelly himself in cover girl and a cartoon animation  it's doubtless that this first daring  inventive kelly dance with jerry has reserved a place for anchors aweigh in film history and the hearts of classic film buffs  but it's also notable for being the first of three kelly  sinatra film collaborations  and though rather too drawnout  still a great couple of hours of entertainment  watch it first  then again and maybe againit'll grow on you before

1,anthony minghela's writer  director cold mountain is a carefully constructed  sensitive  and intelligent drama set in the social context of the confederacy during the civil war  which deals with the politics of the war in a very subtle and realistic manner  while it accurately depicts the brutality and inhumanity of that war  it also does something that many films related to this period to not handle as effectively  cold mountain studies the southern context from the inside out  and portrays changes among the nonslave owning common people wrought by the war  and  almost uniquely  cold mountain does not overgeneralize southerners  northerners or anybody else the film surfs through genres as needed  never presenting a dull moment  it is a romance  a war story  an actionadventure and historical fiction  all nicely woven into one the story centers on inman jude law and ada monroe nicole kidman  who are smitten with each other for very simple reasons  as this young romance begins to bud  inman enlists in the confederate army  taking with him a book ada has given him and a photograph of her  ada's character is one of the most brilliant aspects of the film  which is important because the audience experiences this film from a third person perspective  but the story is clearly hers from the beginning to the end  ada is an intelligent southern belle and daughter of a liberal minister  she begins the film as a daddy's girl skilled in many of the arts that southern women who have been surrounded by servants most of their lives were expected to learn  in other words  as she admits to ruby thewes renee zellweger  she is a master of everything useless ada's father passes on  and she is left to manage his modest estate by herself  with no experience of this sort  she struggles  and survives by holding the memory of inman close to her heart  ruby enters the picture as a tough young woman who has been raised by a drunk and negligent father  ruby has all the skills and abilities ada lacks  and as they become inseparable business partners  they grow to love one another as best friends  inman's experience is radically different  but something of a mirror image  during his participation in the war  he sees many friends killed for causes they don't really believe in  and decides to desert  nobody he meets comes to his rescue as he begins the thousand mile walk back to cold mountain and ada  and most of those he meets die the bulk of the film takes place during inman's long walk  following both of the protagonists as they live  learn  grow and change  an ongoing act of will borne of desperation preserves their intense passionate love  for inman  it is his only source of hope in a world of pure desperation  for ada  it is very much the same thing  but also a symbol and remnant of the old south  a world which is rapidly passing the cinematography is powerful and breathtaking  there are beautiful shots of appalachian landscapes which give the film a strong sense of history  the script and editing are also extremely strong  emphasizing the broad class and educational differences reflected in the ante bellum southern dialects of the middle and lower classes  with the cast of this film  nothing short of perfection should be expected  and the cast  mostly  rises to the occasion  my one criticism  however  relates to the accents adopted by kidman and law's characters  an australian and a brit probably should not be expected to accurately reproduce southern american speech  but there are a few occasions where these two exceptionally

be seen as a separate group either although based on the original paramount film there's over half an hour cut out and the director's bland indifference makes what's left imminently threatened with rare differences the younger generation wasn't interested in watching old black and white movies on tv back in those days today alas so this very compelling tale was new to the overwhelming majority of viewers then as now ratings rule and cashing in was its only reel raison d'etre gus van zandt remade alfred hitchcock's psycho for two reasons and if these redux led to the seeking out of the original films or novels so much the better i loved the james m ross source novel enough to tune in back then and i enjoyed this time capsule curio the second time around for the red hair halter tops turbans ugly decor and lush auburn locks of gold star samantha eggar who didn't try too hard in addition to recognizing a few of the incidental cast from a childhood spent in front of the boob tube lee j cobb was able to hold my interest as a worldweary tiredlooking keyes but richard crenna's affable and sir walter neff only reminded me of bill bixby on a sunny little improvement upon the left was of course never intended in a rush to make a buck but instead of a pleasant dream a musical interpretation of the novel would have been a novel idea cain's book differs somewhat from its celluloid incarnations and the horrific shark fins in the same ending is killer the completist in me is thankful this speeded up me decade update was released as part of the double indemnity dvd extras but the experience not only made me want to see the original it had me looking for any episode of the bettermade columbo tv series i also flashed back to a very good abc tv movie of the week that i haven't seen since its initial airing john d macdonald's linda starring the beautiful stella stevens as a ruthless femme fatale who murders her lover's sexy john saxon wife and then frames her mildmannered husband for the crime and if i recall correctly there's also an openended ending like double indemnity it was needlessly remade with tv movie queen virginia madsen as the titular vixen and richard thomas as the milquetoast husband,0.6285985708236694,26,0.9455109559821602,Y,0.05689277899343545

for a twosome  it's fun to see them interacting together in real life of course  the film has a few drawbacks  it's not very cinematic but can such a movie be   the musical soundtrack could have been

0,well  i can honestly say that this is the first time that i experienced a film that had literally no meat or potatoes in it  the entire film felt like it was just the salad with no main course  the story line was fallible and laughable  the characters were onedimensional  the realism was out the window  and the animation was done by fouryear olds  does that cover it  i have never been more embarrassed for a concept in my entire life  i have never read the comics or seen the other programs with this character  but from the looks of the other reviews i am not off base with my observation to begin  the story moved too quickly  for someone new to this character and situations  i needed more built into creating the reasons instead of finding the solution  i have seen other anime if you could call this one an anime that do great things with their characters because they take the time to develop them  there was nothing set aside for lady death  in a few short scenes  we see her train with cremator and instantly become this aggressive shebeast of hell  this was hard for me to swallow  considering moments before she was introduced as this weak and feeble woman controlled by her father  suddenly  she is immersed with hatred and can do battle with an existence that has been around for millions of years  this was absurd  the presentation of lady death was poor  to say the least  i felt as if she was nothing more than an animated character instead of a desperate woman with revenge on the mind  for me  it just didn't work  she was nothing more than eyecandy for prepubescent boys wanting to ogle the mass quantities of skin that she suddenly grew on her chest when training with cremator  oh  i felt sick just watching her  the same goes for the character of cremator  who was this random person  the explanation they gave wasn't enough  and instead i was left with more incoherent babbling than actual development  it is a very sad day in hell when we forgo characters to show more violence and action  especially in an animated feature next  there was lucifer himself  let me just say that i think i could do battle with the king of hell and survive  he was weak  his voice was laughable  and he just didn't represent the image that i had in my mind  it was as if disney was in control and wanted to make him semipc  he lacked the darkness and corrupt nature that lucifer embodies  he was not the ruler of hell  but instead just a lackey that had a bigger place to live  speaking of living or dying  how can you die again in hell  that was a concept that definitely needed more explanation  most of the characters were worrying about dying  when they didn't even consider the option that they were already dead  that is how they got to hell  i think it was this level of thinking that ruined the film for me  i didn't quite capture the notion that your soul was still in a solid body in hell  but that could just be me or maybe it was because there was no development in this story  there was nothing built  just preparing the battle sequences were hysterically bad  the animation in this cartoon felt like it was made in the early s  there was nothing impressive about the way that this film was drawn  why are we  america  so behind on animation  it is huge in asia  and it is creeping in hardcore here because we keep making films like lady death that do not challenge or use any part of imagination  we are cheap  and this film shows it overall  this film was bad  the animation coupled with the horrendous voice work was cheap  i had head somewhere that this film as in production for a long time  which is hard to understand because i think i could have made this film on my credit card  the production was horrendous as well as the story  nothing was developed  leaving huge gaping plot holes that nearly everyone fell into  the strength of the characters was missing  and nothing was explained  i wasted my time with this one and would

school so it in no way relates to this film  but  hey  it's a slasher flick  those are part of the fun  also  the underutilization of characters was heavily exhibited in this film  there were six main characters not including the security guard and  to be honest  only three or four were really used  two characters the token black guy and some other girl that wasn't important enough to get a label barely spoke  between them  i'd estimate about five or six lines total  also  the girls other than one weren't formed well enough to differentiate them from one another  they could've replaced each of the girls with one another repeatedly throughout the film and i wouldn't have noticed the difference  the pacing  however  works well as the horror begins right from the start and rarely ceases  the atmosphere is utilized well and the direction reveals some truly chilling moments    although  the overall appearance is a bit cheaplooking due to  what i assume is  lowgrade camera equipment and operation  the ending  though i liked the idea they were going for  was fairly poorly done  it felt rushed and without explanation enough to make it effective  with the amount of time they spent running around looking for nothing  they could've spent a little bit more time on the conclusion to make sure it didn't feel like some random event thrown in for no good reason which is a flaw many modern horror films are afflicted with  however  ignoring a few irksome issues and trying to focus on the first  of the film rather than the ending  this is actually a rather good modern slasher that

buckets  the violence is extremely well done  not to excess  but pretty brutal at points  sex  nudity  little bit  and with the hottest girl in the film  cool killer  well  security guards are hardly

atmospheric horror obligatory slasher elements violence gore there's a good bit of blood and gore realistically done but not buckets the violence is extremely well done not to excess but not brutal at points sex nudity little bit and with the hottest girl in the film cool killer well security guards are hardly considered 'cool ' but this guy is pretty wicked his wicked smile was chilling scares suspense the suspense is topnotch very tense very well done there are also some extremely creepy moments that fused jump scares and the spooky atmosphere mystery none at all really awkward dance scene of course between a couple of guys and a halfunwilling female in the flashback classic quote of the film 'one more trophy ' final verdict this may be stretching it but fans of session might want to check it out simply for the similar tone and atmosphere ap,0.4378654062747955,14,0.9666059502125076,Y,0.024475524475524483

1,i had lost faith in sooraj r  barjatya after the movie main prem ki deewani hoon  then a year back now i saw promos for vivah which looked good  but i didn't want to waste my hard earned money watching it in cinema  when the film first came out on dvd i rented it and watched and i loved the movie and took back my words for sooraj  i just finished watching it yesterday again and this time i thought i have to review this movie  sooraj r  barjatyagot it right this time  okay i was not a huge fan of hum app ke hai kaun  but i have always loved manie pyar kiya  after manie pyar kiya to me i think vivah is barjatyas best work  i hardly ever cry in a movie but this movie made me feel like crying  if you have ever been in love before then there will be many moments that will touch you in this movie  the movie is just too sweet and will have you falling in love with it  my view a much underrated movie the story of this movie you might call desi and very old times  but to me it seemed modern because the two couples which are getting an arrange marriage are aware it's an old tradition  it's done in present times  lots of people don't believe in this arrange marriage  but i do  the journey between the engagement and wedding which will always be special and this movie shows it clearly  when prem meets poonam for the first time  they show it how it is and that's reality and my parents where saying that's how they got married and it showed it in a way which is so real yes people the way prem and poonam meet in this movie is how most marriages happen  it was a very sweet  you feel nervous yet excited  the song do ajnabe shows that very well  getting back to the story yes it's a journey which you soon get glued to between prem and poonam shahid kapoor and amrita rao and there families  a twist occurs in this movie which is really good  the last mins you all will be reaching for the tissue box what makes this film so amazing is the chemistry between prem and poonam  how they fall for each other is too sweet  simple boy and simple girl  when they first meet during and after the song do anjane ajnabe it's very sweet to watch  she hardly says anything and prem does all the talking being honest with her about his past and the girl he liked and him smoking  then it leads on to them all having a family trip and then that's when they really do fall for each other  it makes you just want to watch the couple and watch all the sweet moments they have  another factor is that poonam chichi is really mean to her and you feel sorry for poonam because she has been treated bad and makes you want to see her happy and when she finally finds happiness  you too start feeling happy with her the movie basically makes you fall in love with poonam more then just prem  when she finds happiness through prem you want her to stay happy and also hope nothing goes wrong because the character is shown as a sweet simple girl  which brings me to performances and amrita roa as poonam is amazing in the movie  her best work till date you will fall in love with this innocent character and root her on to find happiness  shahid kapoor as prem is amazing too  he is poonam support in the film  he is her happiness the movie  together they share an amazing chemistry and i have never seen a cuter couple since srk and kajol  if ishq vishk didn't touch you to telling you how cute they are together this surely will  mujhe haq hai the song and before that is amazing chemistry they show  scenes which touched me was when prem takes poonam to his room and shows her that's where they will be staying and he opens her up and they have a moment between them which is too sweet  again if you have ever been in love with someone that much these scenes you can defiantly connect to  the film is just the sweetest thing you will see ever the direction is spot on  to me a good movie is basically something that can pull me in and stop me believe for this hours what is being seen here is fake and there is a camera filing them  to me this film pulled me in and for those three hours i felt really connected to the movie  the songs you will only truly like when you have seen the movie as they are songs placed in the situation after i saw the movie i been playing the songs non stop  the music is amazing  the story is simply amazing too what more can i ask for what i can finally say it  rarely do we get a movie that makes us feel good  this movie after you have seen it will make you feel really good and make you want to be a better person  its basically the sweetest journey ever  its basically showing you they journey between engagement and marriage and many people say it's the bestest part of your life well this movie actually shows you way do people actually

1,i watched asterix and obelix in operation cleopatra  which was my first exposure to the live action version of the classic comic  like the comic the whole movie is full of jokes based upon puns  anachronistic jokes and slapstick gags which rarely fall flat asterix and obelix are gauls who use a strength potion to fight the roman legions in their native gaul  here they end up in egypt helping a friend build cesar's palace yes its puny in three months to prove the egyptians are just as good as the romans the reason i picked this up was because monica belluci is cleopatra  she's good but the role is little more than a cameo  however  even though she's rarely in the film i didn't care since its so clever and the jokes so funny i was in hysterics  i loved it  i loved it so much that i can't understand why the movies have never been released in the united states the import dvd has the film in english dub which is quite good especially when you consider that when you watch it in the longer french version the puns and hence the jokes are not always apparent since they are aural  so if you read the names wrong the jokes are lost  most of the jokes between the full french version and the shorter english dub seem to be exactly the same  though some have been changed sometimes for the better and some times for the worse  personally i'm gonna stick with the dub when i watch this again since its easier to pick up the jokes and enjoy the humor you really will want to see this if you love puns and low brow  but clever humor this is a great comedy,0.982030987739563,0,i watched it and still in operation cleopatra which was my first exposure to the live action version of the classic ones like the comic the whole movie is made of paper based upon puns anachronistic jokes and slapstick comedy which rarely fall flat asterix and obelix are gauls who use a special potion to fight the roman legions in their native lands here they end up in egypt helping a friend build cesar's palace has its puny in three months to prove the egyptians are just as good as the romans the reason i picked this up was because monica belluci is cleopatra she's good but the role is little more than a cameo however even then she's rarely in the film i didn't care since its so that and the not so funny i was in hysterics i loved it i wanted it so much that i should understand why the movies have never been killed in the baltic states the import company has the film in english as which is quite good except when you consider that when you watch it in the longer film version the puns and hence the jokes are not always bad since they are aural so if you read the names wrong the jokes are lost most of the jokes between the full french accent and the american english dub seem to be exactly the same though some have been changed sometimes for the better and some times for the worse off i'm going stick with the dub when i watch this again since its easier to pick up the jokes and not the humor you really will want to see this if you made puns and low brow but no humor this is a great comedy,0.4652108252048493,28,0.9217221135029354,Y,0.09491525423728814
