0,first of all  this film is glacially slowmoving  and i can see most viewers losing patience with it altogether in the first thirty minutes the film's subject matter was one i think would form the basis of an excellent film  what was most lacking here was a plot that would advance the underlying themes it's unfortunate  because in the hands of a writer like  say  lanford wilson  i think symbolism like a mountainlion invading a school campus could take on great  tragic proportions without being heavyhanded i think  with a good script supporting the film  the same filmmaker  with the same tastes  and even with the same actors who didn't really even get a chance to impress me  might have been able to present a meaningful and touching depiction of the pains and struggles that a boy goes through when he develops a powerful crush on an older boy that he admires however  i'm sorry to say that without this foundation  and armed with a vague  dullwitted  and vastly uninteresting script  without any sort of plot in sight  and lacking any sort of sensible structure for example  after viewing it  i believe you will find that you cannot point to climactic scenes  and instead  will find yourself enumerating well  maybe that scene  or that one  were climaxes  the result is minutes of tedium without a good plot  we never get terribly interested in any of the characters  their trials and difficulties are simply dull and boring without a good plot  dramatic devices and surrealistic directorial liberties become puzzling and confusing rather than enhancements to the storyline  i never really could believe  for example  the creation of leah and i think that most viewers would be utterly baffled by the conventional way in which her telephone calls were filmed as the film stands  i'm afraid it's one i cannot recommend at all  what i can never understand is why a film like this one isn't remade by an enterprising filmmaker  instead of all the mediocre remakes of films that were superlatively good in the first release  all it needs is a good script  written by good writers  and i think this film could be easily turned into an unforgettable classic about an aspect of male comingofage that is rarely treated in drama  all the elements that were so tedious and seemed so recherche in the film the messages written on the boy's belly  the leah scenes  the televisionscreen fantasies could become rich if underpinned with a good storyline i see in quite a few comments that people are talking of this film as somehow being about a gay subject  and i think that's mistaken  obviously  the crush depicted is that of a newly pubescent boy on an older adolescent boy  but the character of logan is far too young to have settled on any particular sexual choices  and  indeed  in his depicted masturbation fantasies  we see all sorts of stimuli  sexual and nonsexual  as we would expect in a very young boy like him  i believe crushes such as logan's are common among male youths who grow up to have a decided preference for female sexpartners ,1,first of all this film is glacially slowmoving and i can see most viewers losing patience with it back in the first

nice day it's hell with cockney accents i suspect this programme must be sponsored by the equates it's perfect viewing for the depressed it doesn't cheer them up what it does do is present a totality community of such terminally despondent sadarses that viewers are moved to believe their lot really could be worse they might be living in 'albert square'apart from the above as a representation of london's east end it is pure hokum the programmemakers have evidently never been across town the premiere thing you encounter on the mile end road is a colossal mosque and this prettywell defines the racial majority of the population white british londoners are a dispersed and quick diminishing minority a large advertisement hoarding current close the bow road constructed and sponsored by tower hamlets health empathetic boasts that 'eight out of ten members of the community can now see their doctor more quickly' ten healthy smiling faces beam down at the observer in confirmation eight of them are darkskinned what's more i used to work with a bunch of anglosaxon dare i say 'pukka' cockneys a few years ago and i can tell you that a more obnoxiously ethnic experience i've never had each day was adore an oswald moseley rally they couldn't passport minutes not denigrating some other race or nationality than their own and in terms that were repulsive and obscene 'fackin' pakis' and 'fackin' maceroons' were the small change of conversation in fact their entire and extremely limited stock of adjectives fixated after sexorgans and their application alf garnett was a paragon of liberal virtue in comparing any programme that purported to represent london's native eastend caucasians in their true nature would be completely unfit for broadcast even after the oclock watershed imagine a ku klux klan script written by quentin tarantino and you'd be somewhere near the mark but when they weren't being inveterate bigots they were at least extremely cheerful i don't know how such a soapopera came to be this imaginary castaway island of white misery has completely no bearing upon real culture whatsoever and if you're of a comparatively sanguine disposition it will quickly reduce you to tears of heartache comparatively ordinary actors pretending to be comparatively ordinary chronicdepressives with cockney accents what's the point of that dull dreary unrelentingly disillusional and ethnically preposterous the most folk programme of an apparently diseased and dying nation avert it like the

1,streisand fans only familiar with her work from the funny girl film onwards need to see this show to see what a brilliant performer streisand was  before she achieved her goal of becoming a movie star  there had never been a female singer quite like her ever before  and there never would be again sorry  celine  only in your dreams   but never again would streisand sing with the vibrancy  energy  and  above all  the enthusiasm and vulnerability with which she performs here  by the time she gets to that central park concert only or years later  she'd been filming funny girl in hollywood and her performing style has become less spontaneous and more reserved  more rehearsed and  let's face it  more angry  there's a wall between her and the audience  live performing was never what she really enjoyed  she did it because she knew it was her ticket to hollywood  and once she no longer had to do it she's done it as little as possible and oh  that legendary stage fright provides such a good excuse  her vocals here and on her earlier judy garland show appearance are incredible  streisand could truly make an old song sound new again  and composers such as richard rodgers and harold arlen loved her for it  but by the s streisand was trying to be a rock singer  her albums pandering to the younger audiences  with overwrought shrieking of songs that were unworthy of her effort or her voice  in the 's she came back with that brilliant broadway album  but went on and on about what a struggle it was to get it done  how they told her not to do it  etc  oh please  when has anyone told streisand what to do  she could have been doing good stuff like that all along  bringing audiences up to her level instead of stooping to what she thought the young public wanted  the back to broadway sequel wasn't nearly as good  as streisand seems to feel it necessary to improve on other composers' work  if he were alive at the time  would richard rodgers have even recognized his own some enchanted evening rodgers  notorious for taking singers to task for playing around with his melodies  would undoubtedly have been after streisand to sing what he'd written  she also blows michael crawford off the cd in their duet of music of the night  apparently reminding him just whose cd this is  why does she insist on taking songs that are duets and singing them by herself  and songs that aren't duets and singing them as duets with someone else who she then goes on to diminish supposedly judy garland took streisand aside and advised her  don't let them do to you what they did to me  advice streisand wasted no time in heeding  despite her protestations to the contrary  surely it looks like it's always been her way or the highway  just imagine  she told the cbs brass how her first tv special would be done  no guests  just her but nobody can argue with the results that are so evident here  treat yourself to this brilliant musical phenomenon before she was a legend  you'll be absolutely amazed at the difference ps  i watched this again last night    after not having seen it for many years  it was even better than i remembered  the st act begins with i'm late and includes make believe and how does the wine taste  and barbra's homage to childhood  i'm five  it climaxes as streisand appears with full and i mean full orchestra to sing people  she wasn't bored with the song yet and although it's a somewhat shorter rendition it really soars  compare it to some of her later autopilot versions  the nd act after streisand's kooky schtickpatter  which hasn't changed much over the years is the famous series of depression songs set amidst the extravagance of bergdorfgoodman's the rd act is the stunner  call it streisand  the orchestra  and the audience although we never see the audience that supposedly witness this historic event  with her fear of audiences and dislike of such performing  this may have been the toughest part for her  but if so  to her credit it doesn't show  she tears through lover come back to me and the torchy when the sun comes out though i can't remember in which order   the poignant why did i choose you  one of my alltime favorite streisand performances and offers a medley of funny girl songs  including of course don't rain on my parade and my favorite song from the score  the music that makes me dance explaining that fanny brice sang a song like that in and it made her the toast of broadway streisand then sings my man and it's almost a dressrehearsal template for her later screen rendition in the funny girl film the main difference being that the black gown here is sleeveless  her film gown had long sleeves and against the black background all we saw were her hands and face  but the vocal here is more urgent and charged than her later film vocal  her performance of the song has everything to do with streisand and nothing to do with fanny brice who  of course  never sang the song in such an allout manner as streisand does here or in the film  see the great ziegfield for a glimpse of brice's more understated version  the show ends with streisand singing happy days are here again over the credits when it was over i said to the friend i was watching it with  she has never  ever  done anything better and she was twentythree years old ,0,streisand fans only familiar with her work from the funny girl film

melodrama road to perdition  some critics have hailed this new movie as a worthy successor to the godfather  a rash judgment made by several reviewers taken with mr  mendes' extraordinary technical prowess  if the mechanics of movie making are what make a picture great  then yes  road to perdition is a distant cousin to the godfather in terms of what it achieves in cinematography  editing  music scoring and sound  what it doesn't have is a resonance that all great stories and some very rare movies have that stay with the viewer long after the experience of reading or seeing it is over  as with american beauty  there is a cold  distancing feel to this movie  despite some very tense scenes involving paternal love  loyalty and betrayal this story of a hit man tom hanks and his relationship to a surrogate father  figure who is also his boss  an elderly irish mob leader paul newman  seems to have been culled from innumerable gangster movies of years past  the father  son motif that hangs over this picture is so heavy handed in its treatment that there is not much room for spontaneity  the entire enterprise has been very carefully wrought  and nearly all the dialog is delivered with an air of great portent  this is obviously a gangster film  hence the requisite amount of violence and bloodshed  but the film is nearly devoid of any humor to speak of  only in scenes involving a young boy driving a getaway car in a cunningly edited montage is there any sense of lightheartedness to leaven the pervasive sense of doom that being said  i have nothing but the highest praise for the stunning look of this film  indeed  it is not an overstatement to say that this is one of the most beautifully photographed and designed movies i have ever seen  veteran cameraman conrad hall will very likely win another oscar for his work here  the production 's sets and costumes are just as exemplary  in fact  the entire film is a technical marvel  mr  mendes continues to astonish with his vivid use of color  and he and mr  hall again make very dramatic use of red blood splattered against pale colored walls  all the more effective and disconcerting due to the preponderance of blacks  blues and grays that dominate the movie's color scheme if i have failed to duly note the acting  it is not because the actors do not purport themselves ably  everyone in the film is top notch  with special mention going to the two malevolent bad guys  daniel craig is the classic man you love to hate the spoiled  impulsive son of newman's gangster father  and an almost unrecognizable jude law as an especially slimy miscreant who goes on pursuit of hanks and his son and figures very importantly in the film's riveting second half  but acting in a movie this dazzling is bound to take a back seat to the photographic fireworks on display here  if a rollsroyce was a movie  i've no doubt it would look like road to perdition ,0,i f you thought sam mendes' first film

sincerely  then it's actually possible for the film to work  for example  when you watch freddy got fingered as a traditional grossout comedy  it's complete and utter garbage  when you watch it with the understanding that it's actually a neosurrealist comedy  it's brilliant it works with good movies too  if jaws hadn't accepted the reality it created  the airtank explosion ending wouldn't have worked  but  a lot of people think jaws is vastly overrated for this type of reason  and they aren't wrong  but it has it's strengths  doesn't it  the point being that a movie like this makes sense if you look at it with the right perspective  some people  like me  get it right away  while others never will no matter how often it's explained  jim jarmusch made a compelling defense of showgirls once  and even afterwards i still can't see it from his p o v  doesn't mean he's wrong though  if you have the right frame of mind when you watch this movie and no i do not mean stoned  i'm gonna put that to bed right now  you can actually enjoy the movie for the dumb  cheap  pointless slapstick lates  earlysstyle farce that it is the defenders and haters of this film are right  it's stupid  and that's the point  the movie accepts the stupidity of the characters much in the same way the jerk accepted navin johnson's idiocy  and because it takes that and runs with it  the movie focuses exclusively on using that to forward the plot and to define the characters  a bad movie would actually do this and fail to use that logic properly  bad movie are bad because they make it up as they go along  whereas movies like the stupids knows where it's going  what it's doing and why from the beginning i can't defend the film from an artistic standpoint  which is why i give it such a low rating  the acting is mostly bad  the jokes very superficial  and the liveaction quality probably ruins what would have worked as a cartoon  but i can't deny that it is entertaining in its own way  and that's why i defend it  i got it right away  and i pity those who don't i'll admit i was drawn to this movie because of christopher lee's delicious cameo appearance hearing him say release the drive bee  would have been worth the rental price even if i hated this film  but was amazed to find that  aside from the tv studio applause sign segment with jenny mccarthy  i was never bored  and never disappointed  in fact  many of the jokes  because of their cartoonish context  were hilarious in particular the airbagcigarette explosion  they were dumb  but they were funny  and the movie doesn't pretend to be anything else  a stupid comedy about stupid characters and instead of apologizing for it  it enjoys itself and that's exactly why it works ,1,this is probably the only film i've seen where the imdb reviews on both sides of the spectrum are accurate the stupids is an equally dimwitted film with absolutely no artistic merit whatsoever and is a denigration to a boy like john landis and that's what makes it great in order to appreciate the stupids you have to keep in mind a littleknown but very true maxim spoken by director abo kyrou i urge you to learn to look at bad films they are so often sublime in

0,well  on it's credit side if it can be said to have one  timothy hines did manage to capture the original setting of h g  wells' outstanding novella  but other than that  well  to call a spade a spade  it sucks bigtime  what the master ed wood could have done with the alleged  million dollar budget  timothy hines really does make mr  wood  who was a flawed genius anyway  look like the best filmmaker of all time  the special effects i guess you'd call them that are not even up to computer game standards  the acting is  well  perhaps about dinner theater comparable  and the accents are atrocious  at the risk of sounding offensive  a lot of the acting from the principal male characters is especially poor ogilvy  well  ahem     gay  poor ogilvy minces and flounces about the bogus english countryside  waving his asbestos white handkerchief about as if it were heat resistant armor  hey  the stormtroopers in star wars had neat white body armor too  and it didn't work either  they still got blasted  even when ogilvy and company get fried by the martians' 'heat ray'   they flounce and mince in some weird kind of dance  even when they're theoretically dead and reduced to skeletons  which persist in unseemly dancing and writhing  maybe timothy hines rented the skeletons from ray harryhausen  being left over from jason and the argonauts or was it josie and the pussycats i dunno  the soldiers  presumably because they're 'military' all seem to just rather unconvincingly explode  like the soldier on crutches and his unfortunate comrades carrying the stretcher just beyond him  wow  i loved it  but the 'soldiers' all looked like they were either fascist troops from the spanish civil war  or boer commandos which would be more or less correct for the period  perhaps that was some bit of shrewd subtlety on the part of that wicked genius hines   oddly enough  the character of the curate looks exactly like he's drawn in the original illustrations by warwick goble  and he also turns in the most convincing job of acting  oh  yeah  musn't forget the thunder child  in the book  the warship is described as an ironclad torpedoram  it was meant to ram enemy ships  yet  it's bow was crumpled after ramming the tinkertoy constructed martian war machines  with a tiny jagged hole in the forepeak  and she sank  an ironclad warship like thunderchild could've rammed the titanic and survived  but i guess the royal navy was bound by the same lowestbidder constraints as our own military  the costumes are all wrong  especially the british army and police uniforms  cobbled together mostly from usmc alphas  and timbo  in an obvious homage to western films of yore  has obviously set his movie in wild western england  because all his riders are using western saddles  the accents being used by just about everyone appear to be a mixture of some kind of scottish regional accent used by clan macabre  and magically delicious irish accents from county malarky  on the credit side  and contrary to what one reviewer wrote  the only genuine  authentic feature of this thing is the artillery  the guns are not from the civil war  but appear to my eye and research as bonafide british nine or pounder rifled breach loaders  perfectly authentic to the period  so was the ammunition shown being used  but the artilleryman  who is a driver in the horse artillery  was not shown correctly driving his limber  you don't sit on the frigging limber box and drive a gun team  you ride the nearside wheel horses  the opening  using what i believe is authentic period film footage  is okay  and the score's not bad  however  to the best of my knowledge weybridge has never had an underground  and it certainly didn't in but growing up reading this novel  i am very disappointed  even more disappointed then i was at spielberg's zillion dollar  special effects laden version  maybe his version would have profited by swapping anthony piana for tom cruise  and vice versa  i have a lot more to say  but i'll let it go at this for now  i wish somebody would make a good version of war of the worlds that's faithful to the original  timmy's vision is fine for a high school film class  or maybe i should say pretentiously stupid for a collegelevel film student  and about as bad  which is about the best i can say for this thing  but that's about it  oh  yeah  just where did the budget go  and what happened to michael caine  i'd like to hear his comments  i have a sneaking suspicion that timbo orson wood hines' breathtaking  boundbreaking cinema masterpiece just might be the risktaking director's ticket to cult stardom  because  i must confess a guilty pleasure at watching this movie  which i didn't pay for anyway but was thoughtfully sent to me by a friend who burned a dvd copy for me  with no malicious intent that i've been able to determine  i must add here that i thought blackmoon's dubbed and abridged version was not only a vast improvement  but an absolute  hysterically funny in a good way treat to watch  i find it hard to watch master timbo's version after blackmoon  keep it up  tim  make your own version of dune now  it just awaits the hand of a master like you  and all you headupyourass snobs who hated cloverfield  forget it  it cannot beat timbo hines artistry for sheer hilarious awfulness  hey get a life timbo is worse than the master ed wood  i kid you not ,1,well on it's borrowing side if it can be said to have one exmrs hines did administered to capture the original setting of h sg wells' outstanding novella but other than that well to call a spade a spade it is everchanging what the master edition wood could have done with the supposed million dollar budget evilness hines really does make mr wood who was a flawed

scam that grisby is planning for insurance money  with results that i dare not reveal although they have been discussed over and over by others whatever liabilities pop up here and there in the mystery part of the story and those few noticeable moments where shots were studio dictated  the performances and the look of the film are what remains striking after over fiftyfive years  though he

0,i've never been a huge fan of mormon films  being a mormon  i've always felt that the humor was too exclusive to the lds community and made us seem like a bunch of obsessive wackos  i was hoping

andrew wilson  and fred willard one of my favorites  this would have to be at least a little funny  and besides  church basketball is ripe with potential for plenty of hilarious gags and such  but i must say  throughout the entire movie  it seemed as though no one knew what they were doing  every joke fell flat  and every opportunity for a genuinely funny gag went ignored  the dialogue was bland  and the film had some of the worst character development i have ever seen  every single character but wilson's was less than onedimensional  it's hard to believe that after nine rewrites the film was still as mindnumbingly stale as the train wreck i witnessed  i can't put into words the rage i felt sitting through this  my friends and i were extras in the final game scene  so we went to the premiere in washington city  ut  kurt hale  the director  was there  and i must say  i avoided all contact with him after the show  he waited at the door  seemingly ready for feedback  i couldn't bring myself to tell him that his film not only ripped away a good hour and a half of my life  but it left a nasty  painful scar that i will never forget here are a few specific problems i ha there was a minor love story subplot between the janitor and the chubby piano player  but these two characters came out of nowhere  and were impossible to care about  so my friends and i were left constantly wondering why we were supposed to care about these two lame  uninteresting characters  there were many subplots that popped up every now and then  each promising the audience the chance for laughs  but each one came and went in a puff of smoke  ending before you could even start caring  this was pretty much how the whole movie felt this film was a major letdown  and i feel bad for everyone who's expecting the first real funny mormon movie  true  the jokes in this one aren't too exclusive to mormons  then again  it's hard to tell what was a joke and what was a loud ringing

0,let me state this right from the start  i do not hate this show  i actually quite like some aspects of it  in fact  when i first started to watch it  i quickly became hooked  i was just starting to come out of the whole anime is for kids stereotype  and the mature elements of the show had me intrigued unfortunately  after seeing the whole series through and a few of the films  i can say that my overall disposition has changed  and it falls into almost all of the pitfalls that plague bad anime  seven or eight friends and myself started watching this series on tv  by the end  only one friend and i were still watching and neither of us liked it allow me to explain the plot for you  you can skip this paragraph if you don't want to know  kagome is an average high school student  who one day falls into a magical well near her family run shrine  when kagome comes out of the well again  she has been transported back in time to the feudal era of japan  she meets up with many other characters and they form a group of five or so companions who set off on a journey of revenge  justice  groping in one characters case  overall  they are trying to recover the pieces of the sacred jewel shard which enhances the power of demons who use it while there are many  many side stories and story arcs  there is no were near enough material to occupy episodes  the only story arc that is interesting enough to watch is still sort of dull the band of seven  after the half way mark in the series or maybe even before  it becomes painfully obvious that the plot is frozen in place and whoever made the series decided instead to put in dozens and dozens of filler episodes  these episodes have little to no impact on the story  and rarely even on the characters  in some cases  some characters who had an important role in the story will disappear for dozens of episodes at a time  many episodes follow the exact same cookie cutter patterns as the stories before it  inuyasha shoots windscar at enemy  windscar deflects  characters gasp in horror  enemy turns out to have barrier  characters spent three episodes trying to kill enemy before kagome finally fires sacred arrow at him and he turns to dust  also major spoiler  the conclusion will be revealed the lack of any conclusion makes it seem like you have waisted hours  major spoiler overthe animation itself is above average  and in some cases excellent  even so  reused animation cells plague most action scenes  and it is very hard to ignore them when it is clear that the exact same boulder has flown past a character five or six times in a row on the brighter side however  all of the characters are very well developed and the romances between some of the characters were truly captivating  also  the character designs  appearences  were brilliant and at times among the best i have seen  particularly with the band of seven  there is definitely no shortage of cosplay opportunities here  even so  i found myself hoping that a character would die just so there would be some sort of movement in the plot  and some of the humour in the show between characters is used again and again  one particular joke sit boy is found within the first five episodes  and you can literally expect it to be used again and again for the remaining episodes although there are some good aspects of the show and it is easy to see why it has a huge following  the series seems to be dominated by obsessed fan girls who drool over sesshomiru and inuyasha bottom line  definitely worth checking out  but not worth watching the whole series  the first episodes are very clever  original and enjoyable for anybody  but after that  it simply becomes dull and tedious  watching a tv show should never feel like a chore  but somehow this series accomplishes just that  don't expect much from inuyasha because you will only feel let down ,1,let me state this right from the start i do not hate this show i actually quite adores some aspects of it in fact when i

1,bill crain's rarer than rare 'slasher' movie certainly doesn't follow the standard stalk and slash guidelines that have become so essential of its counterparts  the bogeyman this time around uses grenades and small arms as well as an awesome array of melee weapons   a sin that's virtually unacceptable in most posthalloween genre pieces  but there's still just enough familiarity to keep slasher buffs from checking the rule book and the plot never strays too far from the path that you've grown to expect  just as wally koz's surprisingly decent was seemingly put together with help from various members of his family  mirage seems to have been a joint production from relatives of the director  looking through the credits i noticed numerous 'crains' listed in key positions throughout the construction of the feature  but despite fairly good distribution across the globe  the movie failed to make an impression either side of the atlantic and now it has become pretty much a phantom of the vhs market  nevertheless this only made it appeal to me even more and so i strained my resources to track a copy down it all takes place in the middle of the dessert  which as i'm sure you'll agree is hardly the most exciting location  with that said though  i must admit that there's certainly going to be no chance of any nosey john q laws turning up unexpectedly  four undeniably beautiful youngsters head out into the sand for a night of debauchery and frolics that always seems to rub homicidal maniacs the wrong way  chris jennifer mcallister and her boyfriend greg kenny johnson meet up with amusing new age hippies trip kevin mcparland and mary nicole anton at a make shift camp site in the midst of the dunelike wilderness  greg's older brother kyle todd schaefer and his buxom girlfriend bambi laura albert soon turn up to join the body count applicants in their quest for an early grave  kyle used to date chris before his younger brother took the liberty of stealing his squeeze  something that kyle doesn't seem too keen to forget  sound like a motive for a massacre  well what did you expect  before long an unseen someone driving a truck with tinted windows joins the gathering with a unique set of tricks up his sleeve  will any of the kids survive to turn up for a sequel  i have had trouble tracking down any information at all about this feature  i don't even know if director bill crain is aka william crain  the man behind midnight fear and blacula among others  mirage certainly doesn't appear on his official filmography  so your guess is as good as mine  judging by the credible work behind the camera  i'd have to say that i find it hard to believe that this is the debut of a man with no previous cinematic experience  the film is stylishly photographed with some superb work from dp michael crain  and the director boasts a credible talent for building suspense when it's necessary  r  christopher biggs' gore fx are imaginatively created and gruesome  and kudos to the sleepy head over at the bbfc who inexplicably let this pass through uncut on a usually stringent rating  a couple of the murders are indeed extremely macabre  one guy gets buried up to his neck in sand before coming face to face with a grenade  while another ends up literally legless after loosing a battle with a chain and a pick up truck  there's also some black humor that's surely unintentional  we spend the majority of the feature seeing only the killer's boots as he steps out of his vehicle and stalks the youngsters  but when he's revealed to hilariously resemble keanu reeves circa bill and ted's bogus journey  i didn't quite know what to expect  thankfully crain knows exactly how to keep things creepy and the showdown is particularly mean spirited as the psycho taunts chris sadistically there are some surprisingly good performances on display from an extremely inexperienced cast  the divine jennifer mcallister does a superb job as the heroine and b g  steers portrays off his rocker dementia with finesse  the casting director chose wisely to pick some of the most beautiful females ever slaughtered in slasher cinema and it gratefully doesn't come at the cost of thespian potential  the soundtrack works well to build the desolate atmosphere of isolation  which is carefully handled by a director that should have been signed and nurtured by hollywood bigwigs  watch out for the superb nightmare sequence that is truly horror filmmaking at it's freakiest mirage is a good late entry to the cycle that was somewhat unfortunate to miss a boom year placing amongst the slasher elite  when you consider that this was made with just a cast of seven and a pick up truck  you have to say that they did a damn good job  the flaws are numerous  but never detract credibility from the net result  unfortunately you've probably got more chance of finding liquid gold in your coffee mug than you have of ever tracking down a copy  if you see this one covered in dust on the top shelf of your local video store  then make sure you pick it up  recommended ,0,bill crain's rarer than rare 'slasher' style certainly doesn't follow the standard stalk and slash

in most posthalloween genre pieces but there's still just enough familiarity to keep slasher buffs from checking the rule book and the plot never strays too far from the path that you've grown to expect just as wally koz's surprisingly decent was seemingly put together with help from various members of his family mirage seems to have been a joint production from relatives of the director looking through the credits i noticed numerous 'crains' listed in key positions throughout the construction of the feature but despite fairly good distribution across the globe the movie failed to make an impression either side of the atlantic and now it has become pretty much a phantom of the vhs market nevertheless this only made it appeal to me even more and so i strained my resources to track a copy down it all takes place in the middle of the dessert which as i'm sure you'll agree is hardly the most exciting location with that said though i must admit that there's certainly going to be no chance of any nosey john q laws come up unexpectedly four undeniably beautiful youngsters head out into the sand for a night of debauchery and frolics that always seems to rub homicidal maniacs the wrong way chris jennifer mcallister and her boyfriend greg kenny johnson meet up with amusing stone ageing hippies trip kevin mcparland and mary nicole anton at a make shift camp site in the midst of the dunelike wilderness greg's older brother kyle todd schaefer and his buxom girlfriend bambi laura albert soon turn up to join the body count applicants in their quest for an early grave kyle used to date chris before his younger brother took the liberty of stealing his squeeze  something that kyle doesn't seem too keen to forget sound adores a motive for a massacre well what did you expect before long an unseen someone driving a truck with tinted windows joins the gathering with a unique set of tricks up his sleeve will any of the kids survive to turn up for a sequel i have had trouble tracking down any information at all about this feature i don't even know if director bill crain is aka william crain  the man behind midnight fear and blacula among others mirage certainly doesn't appear on his official filmography so your guess is as good as mineral judging by the credible work behind the camera i'd have to say that i find it hard to believe that this is the debut of a man with no previous cinematic experience the film is stylishly photographed with some superb work from dp michael crain and the director boasts a credible flair for building suspense when it's necessary r christopher biggs' gore fx are imaginatively created and gruesome and kudos to the sleepy head over at the bbfc who inexplicably let this pass through uncut on a usually stringent rating a couple of the murders are indeed extremely macabre one guy gets buried up to his neck in sand before coming face to face with a grenade while another ends up literally legless after loosing a battle with a chain and a pick up truck there's also some black humor that's surely unintentional we spend the majority of the feature seeing only the killer's boots as he steps out of his vehicle and stalks the youngsters but when he's revealed to hilariously resemble keanu reeves circa bill and ted's bogus journey i didn't quite know what to expect thankfully crain knows exactly how to keep things creepy and the showdown is particularly mean spirited as the psycho taunts chris sadistically there are some surprisingly good performances on display from an extremely inexperienced cast the divine jennifer mcallister does a superb job as the heroine and b g steers portrays off his rocker dementia with finesse the casting director chose wisely to pick some of the most beautiful females ever slaughtered in slasher cinema and it gratefully doesn't come at the cost of thespian potential the soundtrack works well to build the desolate atmosphere of isolation which is carefully handled by a director that should have been signed and nurtured by hollywood bigwigs watch out for the superb nightmare sequence that is truly horror filmmaking at it's freakiest mirage is a good late entry to the cycle that was somewhat unfortunate to miss a boom year placing amongst the slasher elite when you consider that this was made with just a cast of seven and a pick up truck you have to say that they did a damn good job the flaws are numerous but never detract credibility from the net result unfortunately you've probably got more chance of finding liquid gold in your coffee mug than you have of ever tracking down a copy if you look this one covered in dust on the top shelf of your local video store then make sure you pick it up

after i saw the ads for it  i ended up seeing it only by chance because some friends of mine had tickets and had one spare so i tagged along  before seeing it i had a fairly good idea that it wouldn't be genius  the premise seemed far too silly and stupid for anything good to come out of it  but at the back of my mind i was thinking but there must be something good about it for uma thurman and luke wilson do to the film   not that i think either of them are particularly terrific but they are bignamed stars who would normally only do films that would enhance their reputations  however  about minutes into the feature i realized that the movie was probably worse than i had at first anticipated  i was shocked at how terrible the script was  it really gave the actors nothing to work with  so much so that they really looked like they didn't know what they were doing especially luke wilson  the story was completely predictable  if you've seen the ad then you've pretty much seen the movie  and there was nothing original about it  it pretty much borrows from every 'superhero' story that has ever been which would be acceptable had the film been set up as a satire of that genre  but alas it wasn't  the direction seemed to be of realism  i got the feeling that the director wanted the film to feel completely realistic and not satire at all  and yet there were some moments in the film that were so unbelievably unrealistic that it would have worked if it were a satire  at one moment in the movie two of the characters seem to die and one of the surviving characters has a line like oh well  she's dead  time to move on and he says it in such a droll voice that it completely didn't make any sense  i found myself checking my watch after about minutes to see how much longer i would have to sit through it  and then it struck me  i began to think i wonder if the studio have made this picture as a test to see if they can make the worst possible movie ever made  and still pull a large audience   i couldn't think of any other reason why this film would be made  for movies to be made these days  the script goes to a massive screening process and very very few scripts actually make it to the production stage  i can't comprehend how this one got past the first draft stage  by the end  and exceedingly  dumbfoundingly stupid climax  i was laughing heartily  just not at what the filmmakers wanted me to laugh at  but instead at how ridiculous and stupid the movie was  thank god i didn't have to pay money to see it  because that would have really annoyed me  oh  and could i just add  that of the two wilson brothers  i have always preferred luke because i think he is a better  more versatile actor  but if he wants to step even further into owen's shadow then this is exactly the way to do it  i doubt that he will get many more job offers after this crappy waste of hours  and remember  it only got a generous  because i couldn't select ,1,first off i would likes to facet out that the reason why i gave this movie celebrity out of is because there is no option to give it no star it really is that how i was never eager to look this movies after i seen the ads for it i ended up seeing it only by luck because some friends of mine had coupons and had one spare so i tagged in before seeing it i had a fairly good for that it wouldn't be genius the prerequisite sounded considerably too daft and stupid for anything good to coming out of it but at the back of my mind i was thinking but there gotta be somethings good about it for uma thurman and luke wilson do to the movies not that i think either of them are particularly terrific but they are bignamed stars who would ordinarily only do films that would enhance their reputations however about mins into the feature i effected that the movie was probably lousiest than i had at first anticipated i was shocks at how horrific the dashes was it really delivered the actresses nothing to work with so much so that they really looked like they didn't know what they were doing particularly luke wilson the story was fully predictable if you've seen the ad then you've pretty many seen the movie and there was nothing original about it it pretty much borrows from everything 'superhero' story that has perpetually been which would be acceptable had the movies been set up as a satire of that genre but alas it wasn't the guidance emerged to be of realism i got the feeling that the director wanted the movie to believe completely realist and not spelling at all and yet there were some mins in the film that were so unbelievably utopian that it would have cooperation if it were a spell at one moment in the movie two of the nature seem to die and one of the surviving characters has a line like oh well she's dead period to mover on and he says it in such a amusing voice that it completely didn't doing any sense i found myself checking my monitor after about minutes to see how much longer i would have to sit through it and then it slugged me i began to think i wonder if the studio have made this picture as a test to see if they can deliver the worst possible movie ever made and still draw a large spectators i couldn't think of any other reason why this film would be made for movies to be made these weeks the script goes to a massive screening processed and very very few scripts actually make it to the production stage i can't comprehend how this one got past the first authored stage by the terminating and exceedingly dumbfoundingly stupid climax i was laughing wholeheartedly just not at what the filmmakers wanted me to laughter at but however at how ridiculous and stupid the movie was thanked god i didn't have to pay money to see it because that would have really infuriated me oh and could i just added that of the two wilson brothers i have consistently preferred luke because i think he is a better more supple actor but if he want to step even further into owen's shadow then this is exactly the way to do it i doubt that he will get many more labor offers after this crappy squandering of period and remember it only got a generous because i couldn't

nothing is out of place  everything is tidy and free of dust  the soles of jimmy stewart's shoes are barely scuffed and the zodiac club  where the witches hang out  it's called a low dive  yet it's a

1,the first time my best friend and i sat down to watch this movie  we were watching it for alex winter of bill  ted's fame  we didn't know what to expect other than who and what it was about by the time the movie was over  we knew that it was love at first sight  this movie  while not completely historically accurate  was and is the best one of its genre  i have seen other movies depicting the history of this famous summer and in my opinion  none of the others can compare  it fibbed a little at certain details  but those parts did not take away from the sheer elegance and romance of the story  i have seen the other movies about this summer and i find most of them to be good  but none as captivating as this one haunted summer has the qualities of a painting  the colors and settings seem to be something one would find on a canvas  framed and hung in a museum or on the walls of an eccentric's home  the costumes were gorgeous and  despite not being the most comfortable clothes in the world  made me want to find a seamstress to create such garb for myself  the whole movie was set on the picturesque lake geneva where i hope to one day go because of seeing this movie and the serenity that these historical figures found there this movie shows  besides the tranquility found by all the escapees of england's harsh judgements  the strangeness that surrounded this adventure as well  yes  there were drugs  it was a fairly common practice during that time  a time when drugs were not illegal  and the taking of laudanum the liquid form of opium was medicinal as well as recreational  shelley suffered from consumption  lord byron suffered the pains of a clubbed foot  it was not surprising that there would be prescriptions of the strong drugs that were in their possession during that summer  and they were poets during a time when experience was the key  there was no time for prudish caution  passion and experience were a big part of the romantic era  and out of the thoughts and discussions of science  religion and philosophy came the creation of a legen frankenstein yes  in this movie  we see the beautiful and liberated mary godwin not married to shelley at that time played by beautiful and talented alice krige  she is the control factor to all that goes on until she  too  gives in to experience  but she stands her ground and experiences things on her own terms  as was the strength that she inherited from her mother and father the actors and actresses in this were perfect for the parts they played  the music fitting  the direction captured the essence of the summer  as i've read about it  this movie was based on a wonderful book haunted summer by anne edwards  if you like this movie  read the book  the author takes the story from what she was able to put together from the actual journals of mary godwin shelley and the other participants of this story if you are a person who loves history even the little inaccuracies from time to time

1,few would argue that master animation director hayao miyazaki is one of the few to hold this ability no  too many are focused on john lassiter's amazing ability to steal other movies plots  turn them into pretty puppet shows and then be lauded as a genius    but i digress miyazaki has given us film after film that deals with important mature issues usually ecologically themed  and has an intelligent script that even the most jaded viewer who would normally despise any film that was animated could thoroughly enjoy if given the chance  still  miyazaki  almost  never forgets who will undoubtedly be in the audience of these movies children that said  i am at a loss to think of another filmmaker with this ability  where else are you going to have a film where a three year old my nephew link will sit still throughout the move  enthralled  a year old my niece amber loving it all her own and able to appreciate the star power of frankie jonas and noah cyrus  a year old my nephew aaron who's review was of course it was good  everything miyazakisan does is good  a year old animation fan brought to tears by the powerful directing and gorgeous animation er  that would be me  and a year old woman my mother able to connect with the mother characters and i'm betting the older charas too and loving the cuteness of the child characters and that is what i respect most about miyazakisan  he seems to speak to his audience in a completely different way than the average filmmaker  on the surface  ponyo could be seen as a simple story about a little fishgirl who gets a taste of the human world and wants to join it and the friend she makes there  a little boy names soske somewhat like the little mermaid  but there is an entire different level at play here  true to form  miyazaki populates his film with intensely strong female characters ponyo's mother  soske's mother  the older ladies in a nursing home are all genuine characters with minds of their own and extremely strong willed but the girl who takes the cake is ponyo herself  once she decides that she likes the human world  she simply uses her own will to achieve her dreams  her father is trying to keep her innocent  and keep her a magical fish  but young ponyo knows what she wants and becomes human out of simply her own determination  once human  she teams up with her friend  soske  whom she loves very much although maybe not as much as ham  soske is asked to be the man of the house at age five when his mother lisa decides she has to help the people at the rest home where she works during a typhoon that has been inadvertently caused by ponyo on her quest to become human  frankie jonas yes  he's related to the jonas brothers  can we just get past that please  gives  perhaps  the best performance in the film as young soske which is good since he has the most lines  his character is also strong willed  but also very respectful and friendly characteristics you're not likely to find in a child character on this side of the pacific in the end  ponyo's father  fujimoto must cope with his daughter's decision and his estranges wife's wishes to allow her to be human  he hopes that ponyo and soske will remember him fondly  and once again  miyazaki refuses to allow a character to become the stereotypical bad guy  although miyazaki has for some reason received some criticism for this  it is  honestly  what makes his movies magical and yet relatable  no one in real life is completely a bad person  all humans are various shades of gray  and that is exactly what miyazaki does with his characters  and then there's the animation itself  in a time when cgi would certainly have helped with the copious amounts of effects shots in this film  especially the water  miyazaki has chosen to incorporate no cgi whatsoever  certainly the hand drawn animation was colored by digital means  but every film in this was handdrawn and i  for one  was extremely grateful for that  the character animation was extremely fluid  and there even appeared to be some lipsync going on quite unusual for an anime film  the backgrounds seemed to be rendered with colored pencil and had an effect all its own on the audience  this is what animation used to look like and what it should look like  in the end  i found ponyo to be thoroughly enjoyable  certainly not miyazaki's best in my opinion  that honor is still held by kiki's delivery service  but still a star fun movie for the entire family ,0,few would argue that master animate director hayao ghibli is eden of the few to hold this ability no

cooper a legend  and louise a very lovely  versatile and underappreciated actress seldom seen in the leading role  i also have nothing against teresa wright  and while not blessed with great range  she usually delivers heartwarming performances from a promising opening  the story slides downhill all the way to the end  i found nothing humorous about burning down the home of cooper's wouldbe inlaws  the butler in such a fastidious  nonsmoking household would never just blithely walk away  allowing cooper to continue smoking  or alternatively he would certainly supply him with some means of disposing of his illtimed cigarette  moreover  nobody with any common sense would permit himself to be left holding a lit cigarette without asking for some means of disposing of it  and finally  nobody in his right mind crushes out a cigarette in a handkerchief and sticks it in his pocket  this whole sequence just made cooper seem foolish and gauche  it is a poor contrivance  ill conceived and filmed in a way that induces ridicule not laughter  the forced medical examination of cooper is equally contrived  nobody lets himself undergo a complete medical examination without his being advised of its purpose or giving his consent  that cooper did so is too removed from reality to be funny  it's absurd  stealing babies from hospitals is a serious legal offense  and that  too  is nothing to laugh about  finally  the scenes of cooper's overly fastidious  neurotic attention to his baby's feeding and weight may have struck a nerve with a few people who have experienced anxiety over their own newborn babies  but to me they just seem tedious and slow  the wardrobe and prop departments went over the top in those scenes  while paradoxically  the script writer went to sleep the lines are just not in the script to generate humor  they just miss on all cylinders  the laughs come not a mileaminute  but more like a light yearaminute  the only time the movie has any energy or humor is when frank morgan is on camera the scene that is totally wasted is when both of cooper's love interests and their respective fathers are cooped up in the same hotel room together  there is probably a rich vein of humor somewhere in that mine  but none of it was extracted in the end  one of the two very likable girls is going to get hurt  predictably  it is the anita louise character  who gets jilted on her wouldbewedding night  while it is not on camera  that is her fate  and it is not particularly funny  even as a loose end  she hadn't done anything in this film to make me unsympathetic unlike gail patrick  say  in my favorite wife  consequently  i was expecting perhaps hoping is a better word in the context of the film  for anita louise to enjoy a happy ending  too  the fact that such a nice character is essentially wiped out at the movie's end really undermines the effect of the happy ending for cooper and wright i kept waiting for something to happen  for the

0,from the weeks and weeks of promotion for this  abc's the one was supposed to be the real world meets american idol  we were to watch these singers perform  compete and see how they lived together in a house as well  the drama  the tension  where does one begin with this atrocity  let's start with the judges who were known as music experts on this program  experts implies they have expertise  andre harrell at least had a pedigree  he was in charge of motown records for a time  the other two  eh  kate hudson's uncle  who could have been labeled mr  weird beard  he dyed his facial hair three distinctly different florescent colors  i wonder how scary he would have been with a black light  and the paula abdul wannabe  who did something i didn't think could happen  she was even more gushing and cloying than paula  she then over corrected and became harshly critical after the first episode  the farce of critiques that these three offered was a true joke and an insult  not only to the process of finding the best singer  but to the audience that is now quite savvy  already having done this numerous times on fox there was the host  george stroumboulopoulos was no ryan seacrest  in fact  he was as lackluster as can be  he actually sucked what little energy there was in the program  dry  how he got that job was the second biggest mystery of the show the first was how did they pick the competitors for this program  this was literally a talentfree talent show  ok  perhaps that's an exaggeration  and granted  the performers all have to be relatively close in ability  because if they were not  there wouldn't be a contest  if only one person was good  there would be no suspense  so  i get that they all needed to be comparable  but they all should have had some chops  additionally  the judges were running a singing academy  so the program was part fame  as well  clearly these performers desperately needed those lessons  but you need some extremely talented people to teach those with little talent to be talented  and that definitely wasn't what was happening here it seemed in casting the show  the priority was on the homelife elements  as all of the players were very attractive to look at  in equal parts to how badly they vocalized  but the filmed segments in their house were so chopped and sliced  you couldn't get into the stories that were starting to happen  so the show didn't capture the events there  either as badly devised as all of that was  the one had an incredible  unbelievable  fatal design flaw built into the results that made it completely laughable the audience phoned in their votes for who they liked the best  just like on ai  but then  after the audience vote was revealed  the bottom three contestants were forced to sing a final song  the music experts  based on that performance  chose one person from the three to save for the following week  and then  the contestants who were safe got to vote for who they wanted to keep from the remaining two  sending the remaining contestant home the design flaw was that the contestants had the final say  i mean  if you were in a music competition and you wanted to get as far along the path as you could  would you vote to keep the better singer  or would you try to get rid of your toughest rival  any first season viewer of cbs's survivor could answer that one  and that's exactly what happened on the program  the person who had the better potential was lost  and the contestants voted back the one who had no talent at all  on top of that  the contestant who was just saved from the bottom by the experts was also allowed to vote against the remaining two  it was a complete farce  maybe if they let the contestants vote first  at least the experts would save the better of two evils to finish  but this just confirms how not ready this show was for broadcast  how unsatisfying the whole process was to view and how misguided the producers were in attempting it

1,i love midnight cowboy and have it in my video collection as it is a favorite of mine  what is interesting to me is how when midnight cowboy came out in it was so shocking to viewers that it was rated x  of course  at that time x meant maturity  since i was only two years old at the time of the movie's release  it is hard for me to imagine just how shocked viewers were back then  however  when i try to take into account that many of the topics covered in the film  which included prostitution the title itself was slang for a male prostitute homosexuality  loneliness  physical and to some extent emotional as well abuse and drugs are hard for many people to talk about to this day  i can begin to get a sense of what viewers of this movie thought back on its release  it is worth noting that in the 's  midnight cowboy was downgraded to an r rating and even though it is still rated r  some of the scenes could almost be rated pg by today's standards i want to briefly give a synopsis of the plot although it is probably known to almost anyone who has heard of the movie  jon voight plays a young man named joe buck from texas who decides that he can make it big as a male hustler in new york city escorting rich women  he emulates cowboy actors like roy rogers by wearing a cowboy outfit thinking that that will impress women  after being rejected by all the women he has come across  he meets a sleazy conman named enrico ratso rizzo who is played by dustin hoffman  ratso convinces joe that he can make all kinds of money if he has a manager  once again  joe is conned and before long is homeless  however  joe comes across ratso and is invited to stay in a dilapidated apartment  without giving away much more of the plot  i want to say that the remainder of the movie deals with joe and ratso as they try to help one another in an attempt to fulfill their dreams  i e  joe making it as a gigolo and ratso going down to florida where he thinks he can regain his health i want to make some comments about the movie itself  first of all  the acting is excellent  especially the leads  although the movie is really very sad from the beginning to the end  there are some classic scenes  in fact  there are some scenes that while they are not intended to be funny  i find them amusing  for example  there is the classic scene where dustin hoffman and jon voight are walking down a city street and a cab practically runs them over  dustin hoffman bangs on the cab and says hey  i'm walkin' here  i'm walkin' here  i get a kick out of that scene because it is so typical of new york city where so many people are in a hurry  another scene that comes to mind is the scene where ratso dustin hoffman sends joe jon voight to a guy named o'daniel  what is amusing is that at first  we think o'daniel is there to recruit gigolos and can see why joe is getting so excited but then we begin to realize that o'daniel is nothing but a religious nut  in addition to the two scenes i mentioned  i love the scene where ratso and joe are arguing in their apartment when ratso says to joe that his cowboy outfit only attracts homosexuals and joe says in selfdefense john wayne  you gonna tell me he's a fag  what i like is the delivery in that scene i would say that even though midnight cowboy was set in the late ''s  much of it rings true today  that's because although the area around nd street in new york has been cleaned up in the form of disneyfication in the last several years  homelessness is still just as prevalent there now as it was years ago  also  many people have unrealistic dreams of how they are going to strike it big only to have their dreams smashed as was the case with the jon voight character  one thing that impresses me about jon voight's character is how he is a survivor and i felt that at the end of the movie  he had matured a great deal and that ratso dustin hoffman's character was a good influence on him in conclusion  i want to say that i suggest that when watching this movie  one should watch it at least a couple of times because there are so many things that go on  for example  there are a bunch of flashback and dream sequences that made more sense to me after a couple of viewings  also  what i find interesting is that there is a lot in this movie that is left to interpretation such as what really happened with joe buck jon voight's character and the people who were in his life in texas  even the ending  while i don't want to give it away for those who have not seen the movie  is rather openended ,0,i love a cowboy and have it in my video collection as it is a favorite of mine what is interesting to me is how when midnight cowboy came out in it was so appalling to viewers that it was classed x of course at that time x meant maturity because i was only two years old at the time of the movie's release it is strenuous for me to presume just how shocked viewers were revert then yet when i attempt to take into account that many of the topics covered in the film which included prostitutes the title itself was parlance for a male prostitute homosexuality hermit physical and to some people emotional as well abuse and drugs are hard for many gens to talk about to this day i can begin to get a sense of what viewers of this movie thought backwards on its release it is worth noting that in the 's tonight cowboy was downgraded to an r rating and even though it is still rated r some of the scenes could almost be rated pg by today's standards i want to briefly give a recap of the plot although it is poorly known to nigh anyone who has heard of the movies jon voight plays a young mens named joe buck from texas who decide that he can make it big as a male hustler in new manhattan city escorting rich women he emulates cowboy actors like roy rogers by wearing a cowboy outfit thinking that that will impress women after being rejected by all the women he has come in he meets a sleazy conman named enrico ratso rizzo who is played by dustin hoffman ratso convinces joe that he can make all kinds of money if he has a manager once again joe is conned and before long is homeless however evel comes in ratso and is invited to stay in a dilapidated apartment without giving away much more of the plot i want to say that the remainder of the movie deals with joe and ratso as they try to help one another in an attempt to fulfill their dreams i and joe making it as a gigolo and ratso going down to florida where he thinks he can regain his health i want to deliver some comments about the movie itself first of all the acting is excellent especially the leads although the movie is really very sad from the beginning to the end there are some classic scenes in fact there are some scenes that while they are not intended to be funny i find them amusing for case there is the classic panorama where dustin hoffman and jon voight are walking down a city street and a cab practically executes them over dustin hoffman bangs on the cab and says hey i'm walkin' here i'm walkin' here i get a kick out of that scene because it is so typical of new york city where so many people are in a hurry latest site that comes to mind is the scene where ratso dustin hoffman sends joe jon voight to a guy named o'daniel what is amusing is that at first we think o'daniel is there to recruit gigolos and can see why joe is getting so excited but then we begin to realize that o'daniel is nothing but a religious nut in addendum to the two scenes i mentioned i love the scene where ratso and joe are citing in their apartment when ratso said to joe that his cowboy outfit only attracts homosexuals and joe says in selfdefense john wayne you want tell me he's a fag what i like is the delivery in that panorama i would say that even though midnight cowboy was setting in the late ''s much of it rings true today that's because although the area approximately nd street in new york has been sanitized up in the form of disneyfication in the last several years homelessness is still just as prevalent there now as it was years ago also many people have unrealistic dreams of how they are going to strike it vast only to have their dream smashed as was the cases with the jon voight character one thing that impresses me about jon voight's character is how he is a survivor and i felt that at the end of the movie he had matured a great deal and that ratso dustin hoffman's character was a good influence on him in conclusion i want to said that i suggest that when watching this film one should watch it at least a couple of times because there are so many things that go on for example there are a bunch of flashback and dream sequences that made more sense to me after a couple of viewings also what i find interesting is that there is a parcel in this movie that is walkout to interpretation such as what really happened with joe buck jon voight's nature and the people who were in his life in texas even

0,i'd have to say that i've seen worse sci fi channel originals  but this nu image shonker from yossi wein was still quite a drag  the big problem with it is that it simply isn't convincing  not just its creature  but acting  writing and any attempts at drama  the direction lacks any kind of flair and the script from boaz davidson and danny lerner never really works  predictable  often laughable  whilst it delivers less howlers than a fair few of these sorts of films it never offers anything to engage or raise the pulse  the actors do their best  but with such material their workmanlike efforts have little effect  matthew reilly burke is a blandly watchable hero  meredith morton similar as a blandly watchable love interest  actually she was a bit less convincing but at least she was easy on the eyes  the film at least has the dignity to bowl along at a reasonable pace  but its biggest plus is that the octopus isn't entirely cgi rendered  so even though it doesn't look good  at least there are a few legit scenes of characters inanely grappling with rubbery tentacles in pretty amusing fashion  i also chuckled at the disparities between different representations of the octopus  the cgi shots of the creature as a whole vary over the course of the film  they are also different not only in size but appearance to the practical shots of it  and there are scenes where the tentacle action suggests that the makers had abandoned pretending they were making a film about an octopus and just envisioned their creature as a bunch of miscellaneous tentacles  the scenes of the creature attacking people get old pretty swiftly  but there are a few funny scenes where it takes on other things  like a boat and a crane  yes  these scenes are poor  but they did make me chuckle  undisputable highlight though is a hilarious sequence in which the octopus takes on a new york landmark  the scene may not be much more than a minute but it really is inspired  and well worth looking up on youtube  apart from that things are uninspired all round  a pg level lack of gore or nastiness stops this one from even pulling off much in the trash good times the film does take a turn into semi gripping disaster movie territory at the end  but i can't really give it credit because the best shots in the last few scenes were culled from the stallone flick daylight which by my recollection is quite good  altogether this was pretty rubbishy stuff and not something i'd really recommend to anyone except creature feature die hards  better than a poke in the eye with a wet stick  but not by much ,1,i'd have to say that i've seen meanest sci fi channel originals but this nu image shonker from yossi wein was nonetheless very a drag the big problem with it is that it simply isn't convincing

up on youtube besides from that things are uninspiring all round a pg level lack of gore or nastiness stops this somebody from even pulling off much in the garbage good times the film does take a turn into semi gripping disaster movie territory at the end but i can't genuinely give it credence because the best shots in the last few scenes were culled from the stallone flick daylight which by my recollection is quite good totally this was pretty rubbishy stuff and not something i'd truthfully recommend to anyone except creature featured die hards best than a poke in the eye with a wets stick

0,i am a pretty much a sucker for those ghost hunter shows  from the cheesy mockumentaries like discovery channel's the haunting to scooby doo reality shows like ghost hunters when i saw promos for a's paranormal state i knew i was going to watch  especially when paranormal state was juxtaposed against a weak monday night football game by the end of the pilot of paranormal state when the main character in this reality dance macabre gives a creepy kid a bottle of max von sydow holy water and reassures him by telling this boy that he  too  had a unspecified bad experience as a child with things that came out of the closet and the  catholic  church gave him a holy water to fend off the things coming out of the closet i knew i should have given monday night football another shot the shtick behind paranormal state is a group of penn state students all got together and started their own ghost hunting club  or society  or super adventure club  and they run around pennsylvania researching the most terrible hauntings and the lost plot to an m  night shymalan movie the they is kind of a misnomer  really paranormal state revolves around a nittany lion named ryan buell who would probably be running penn state's yearly anime convention if it wasn't for this show  he is often accompanied on investigations by hot coeds and some other people seen in the credits but rarely caught on camera  hey  are they ghosts too  this is ryan buell's show  paranormal state is his vehicle as we like to say in the biz  and  oh  what a dull ride in a vehicle he can be did i mention ryan narrates the entire episode of paranormal state in a star dateless director's log voice over  almost immediately that gets annoying because the obvious intention is to give ryan's ghost hunting some gravitas  but his filtered monotone does nothing but provoke grunts and laughs  seriously  every serious intonation sounds like the radio chatter from a call of duty video game the investigations  the plot that each episode revolves around  are interesting on the surface  no haunted inns or restaurants to be found in paranormal state this is a show about fearing the unknown like a good catholic boy and by god they give you stuff to fear  small children are harassed  things loom in the dark  voices encourage the living to kill  and the aleister crowely in me rubs my hands  of the two episodes i watched each revolved around violent  nasty hauntings tied to violent  nasty deaths  maybe maybe not  everything in paranormal state is shorthanded into half hour  dog the bounty  er  ghost hunter blocks  every time there is an interesting  verifiable shred of evidence  the murder of a family in a farmhouse in the s  the proof is waved in front of the viewer like a con artist trying to convince you a stack of papers currently under your nose is proof of that ten million coming from nigeria and then yanked away before you can get a good gander  at least with scifi channel's ghost hunters there is a somewhat overexhaustive need to trot out every possible shred of evidence and present it to the viewer  evps that could be a rat farting  cold spots in a drafty house  and orbs that even the ghost hunters themselves discount as dust  it is a sort of scooby doo like approach that makes ghost hunters  almost believable whereas paranormal state claims to have evps but gives the viewer a ten second video clip of a wave file in garage band with no audio  yep  see  an evp  right  people are claiming to see dark figures in the basement  well  we will just go and see about that  while leaving the night vision camera on an enthralling stationary shot of the living room  ryan  the intrepid leader of this pack of penn state graduates  is claiming to see visions of a demon's name he knows and that might be involved in a paranormal haunting  but he can't tell us  the audience  or his team of gothed out undergrads  because  he can't  you never say a demon's name out loud  ryan informs the wide eyed coed who dare inquires well  how very very convenient for you  especially since this is a television show where the audience cannot read your mind paranormal state is all turn and no prestige  the audience gets told what is supposedly happening but you never see an ounce of proof that the creepy kid is seeing dead people  not even grainy video of a chair moving  or a black blob running between prison cells  nothing  you are just told what happened by ryan in yet another mechanical voice over if you are going to try and spook me dress it up a little  if you are trying to sway me  show me a orb or a blob and have the fat chick who works days at hot topic tell me why that black orb is really the spirit of an ax murderer  and if you want to make me watch a ghost hunting show give me something besides trotting out lorraine warren by the second episode paranormal state is weak sauce  not really worth watching unless you are hard up for tv time  or just have that thin of a dvd collection  or unless you want to know what really happened in that closet with the holy water ,1,i am a pretty much a sucker for those specter hunter displays from the cheesy mockumentaries

paranormal state is his vehicle as we like to say in the evilness and oh what a dull ride in a vehicle he can be did i mention ryan narrates the entire episode of garden state in a celebrity dateless director's log voice over almost immediately that gets irksome because the obvious intention is to give ryan's ghost chasing some gravitas but his filtered monotone does nothing but provoke grunts and laughs seriously every serious intonation sounds like the radio chatter from a call of duty video game the investigation the plot that each event revolves around are interesting on the surface no haunted inns or restaurants to be found in paranormal state this is a show about fearing the unrecognized adores a good catholic boy and by god they give you stuff to fear small infantile are harassed facets loom in the dark voice encourage the living to kill and the aleister crowely in me rubs my hands of the two incidents i watched each revolved about violent nasty hauntings tied to violent nasty deaths perhaps maybe not any in paranormal state is shorthanded into half hours dog the kindness er ghostbusters hunter blocks every time there is an enthralling verifiable shred of evidence the murder of a family in a firm in the s the proof is waved in front of the viewer like a con artist striving to convince you a stack of papers currently under your nose is proof of that ten million coming from nigeria and then yanked away before you can get a good gander at least with scifi channel's ghost hunters there is a somewhat overexhaustive need to trot out every possible shred of evidence and present it to the viewer evps that could be a rat farting cold spots in a drafty house and orbs that even the ghost hunters themselves discount as dust it is a sort of spongebob projecting like approach that makes ghost hunters almost believable while paranormal state claims to have evps but gives the viewer a ten second video clip of a wave file in garage band with no aural yup see an evp right people are arguing to see dark figures in the basement well we will just go and see about that while leaving the night vision camera on an enthralling stationary shot of the living room everchanging the intrepid leader of this pack of pennsylvania state graduates is claiming to see notions of a demon's name he knows and that might be involved in a paranormal haunting but he can't tell us the audience or his team of gothed out undergrads because he can't you never say a demon's name out loud ryan informs the extensive pallid coed who dares inquiries bah how very very convenient for you particularly since this is a tvs show where the audience cannot lis your mind paranormal state is all turn and no prestige the audience gets told what is supposedly happening but you not see an ounce of proof that the creepy children is seeing dead people not even grainy video of a chair mover or a noir blob running between prison heaps nothing you are just told what happened by ryan in yet another mechanical voices over if you are going to try and spook me dress it up a little if you are trying to sway me show me a orb or a blob and have the fat chick who works days at hot topic tell me why that black orb is really the spirit of an ax slayer and if you want to bring me observing a ghost hunting show give me something besides trotting out lorraine warren by the second episode paranormal state is weak sauce not really worth watching unless you are hard up for tv time or just have that thin of a dvd collected or unless you want to soaps what truly happened in

on the task of trying to learn more about his father through an exploration of his architecture and his life  it sounds like a great idea for a documentary  but it ends up flat and uninteresting sadly  the basic problem is that kahn's son  nathaniel  is not just one of the film's protagonists  he is also director  writer  producer  interviewer and narrator  nathaniel seems both too inexperienced and possibly too close to the material to function well in any of these roles  further  while he seems like a nice enough guy  he doesn't have much screen presence  so the fact that he is the only constant in the film becomes wearing  nathaniel also comes across as an unprepared and amateurish interviewer  there are several points where an interviewee makes an interesting or provocative statement and the camera cuts to a shot of nathaniel offering little more than a blank stare and a sort of timid uhhuh  as if he's a little panicked that he's going to have to come up with something to say in response  at times  i felt embarrassed watching people who might have had truly interesting things to say about kahn or at least better things to do with their time seeming to realize that they were in the hands of an interviewer who was going to rely on them to direct the conversation  nathaniel's dual role as both documentarian and lost son seem to do more to hurt the film than help  one senses that some of the interviewees are a little reluctant to really open up about negative aspects of kahn's personality and career  presumably because it's not clear from nathaniel whether he's looking to dig into the truth or simply wants to hear nice stories about his dad  preferably ones that will confirm his hope that his dad really did care more for nathaniel and his mother than seems likely  his passive approach as an interviewer may stem directly from this conflict  the only person nathaniel does push is his own mother  but those conversations tend to feel a little like bad teen drama aren't you angry  mom  and don't offer much in terms of helping us or nathaniel understand kahn or the loyalty he evoked from those around him  what the film desperately lacks is shaping by an experienced and independent hand  not to exclude nathaniel  but to balance his subjectivity and inexperience  an independent director could have stood away from the material  given more thought to what the interviewees could contribute and  one hopes  cut out those portions of the documentary process that just don't work  such as the weird segment with the guy who claims to have see kahn die which made it look as if nathaniel was just being taken in by some loony or the entire bit about hooking up with kahn's first cousin  who had nothing to add about kahn or nathaniel  too many times nathaniel makes us watch him standing in or near a kahn building buttonholing strangers to tell them that his father was the designer  ah huh  thaaat's nice  sir  umm i gotta go now  i understand why these things might be important to nathaniel and that showing the documentary process is sometimes interesting  but this is one of those examples of when a documentary can be too personal as an aside  i thought the score written for the film was great  but  one of the oddest moments in the entire thing for me was when  during the tour of the kimball art museum  the voiceover quotes kahn as making a comparison between architecture and beethoven's fifth symphony  the music being played at the same time  beethoven's ninth symphony  a mistake  a miscue  who knows  it did make me laugh  kahn was a great architect and it's clear that he was an unusual human being and had an intriguing life story  there's definitely a good documentary to be made about him  one is sympathetic to nathaniel's search

1,i would probably not have bothered to comment on this film if i had not been disturbed by the constant references made to it here in north america as a porn film  our obsession with what is  or should be  regarded as pornographic remains a relic of the 'guidance' provided to film makers by the hayes committee many  many years ago and it is now really time that we relegate it to the past  so far we have not progressed far beyond establishing a somewhat arbitrary division between what we now term 'soft' and 'hard' porn  with both carrying the same pornography label  it is time for us all recognise that neither the r rated soft porn  release version of this film  nor the unrated version hard porn  available on dvd were in any way pornographic in legal terms pornography is defined by its capacity to deprave or corrupt  many classic books such as lady chatterley's lover  fanny hill  women in love  the story of 'o' or moll flanders have been prosecuted for pornographic content  tried by jury and cleared on the basis of this definition  but in practice most ordinary citizens are not interested in what they regard as legal equivocation  and apply a simpler test that is rather too stringent when applied to books or films which are very close to the line  but serves to quickly clear most others from any taint of pornography  although the hayes code would have rated aiw as unacceptable both for nudity and for its depictions of sexual activities  in practice most people today accept that where the basic message of a book or film is clearly designed to encourage the development of long term stable family relationships in which the participants find real fulfillment  it cannot be regarded as pornographic this does not mean that works depicting unsatisfactory or unstable relationships should be recognised as pornographic  only that these may need a more sophisticated assessment  in aiw  we have a film about a young female librarian who has had a rather sheltered upbringing  and keeps her suitor at arms length because of a feeling that this is what morality requires her to do  after he gets too frustrated by this and threatens to leave her  she falls asleep and dreams she is transported to a wonderland closely based on that of lewis carrol where everyone she meets is totally uninhibited about their sexual needs  she is shocked  but is a kind person who takes things as she finds them  so before long she finds her own prejudices gradually melting away  she wakes up when her boyfriend returns to break off their affair  but her attitude to him has changed so completely that their relationship is fully restored  and the film ends with them living 'happily ever after' with their children in a home with a white picket fence and a family dog  an ending clearly directed to those romantics who remain very young at heart pornographic   hardly  suitable viewing for children   well probably not quite  unless they have very progressive parents r rating   pg would be more appropriate today entertaining for viewers in most age groups   yes  but the film has its faults  these are discussed in many of the comments here on imdb  however most commentators clearly appreciated and enjoyed it i believe the only pornography associated with this film was the reported claim by an antipornography activist of scientific proof that a magazine picture of kristin debell was a photographic montage of images of the face of a ten year old with various body parts of adult models  these and other comments seriously damaged the career of a very promising young actress  but today the film appears to be on its way to becoming a cult classic  several home video productions have been released in both vhs and dvd format  the last was a dvd containing both the r rated and unrated versions of the film  released by subversive cinema in copies of this were readily available until a few months ago  now they are almost exhausted and the mail order vendors who still have copies in stock are selling them at many times their original price  a situation which usually quickly results in a new dvd release appearing  this continuing interest nearly years after the original film was released points to near classic status commentators on this database are expected to provide fellow viewers with useful guidance on whether a film is worth watching or even collecting  my comments here were intended to stress the ongoing damage to the industry that still results from pressure on major studios to respect selfcensorship recommendations originating with the hayes committee  on this database such general comments are very quickly marked by readers as 'not helpful' and i seldom make them  but fortunately i still have space to add that in my opinion this film is quite unusual and is well worth watching or even buying  it is flawed  but kristine debell gives a great performance and the film provides a fairly unique and rewarding viewing experience  overall i would rate it at stars and will be buying a copy of the next dvd edition if and when it appears  if ms debell is still alive today i would love to hear her comments both

1,if it is true that sadomasochism is a twosided coin which contains the whole in the diverse expression of its opposites  then the cinematic portrait of erika kohut has its reality  professor kohut treats her piano students with a kind of fascist sadism while longing for the same for herself  her outward expression projects her desire  that is why she can hurt without guilt or remorse along comes talented  charming  handsome young walter klemmer benoit magimel who is attracted to her because of her passion and her intensity  he wants to become her student so as to be close to her  she rejects him out of hand  but because of his talent the vienna conservatory votes him in  he falls in love with her  again she pushes him away  but he will not take no for an answer  and thereby begins his own descent into depravity and loss of selfrespect the question the viewer might ask at this point is  who is in control  the sadist or the masochist  indeed who is the sadist and who the masochist  it is hard to tell  is it the person who has just been greatly abused both psychologically and physically  who is actually lying wounded on the floor in grotesque triumphant and fulfillment  or is it the person who is rushing out the door  sated  giving the order that no one is to know what happened but erika is not just a sadomasochistic freak  she is a sex extreme freak  she wants to experience the extremes of human sexuality while maintaining the facade of respectability  actually that isn't even true  she says she doesn't care what others think  she doesn't care if they walk in and find her bleeding on the floor because she is in love  love  she calls it  for her sex and love are one and the same at one point walter tells her that love isn't everything  how ironic such a superfluity is to her  how gratuitous the comment the movie is beautifully cut and masterfully directed by michael haneke who spins the tale with expert camera work and carefully constructed sets in which the essence of the action is not just clear but exemplified as in the bathroom when walter propels himself high above the top of the stall to find erika within  he also employs a fine positioning of the players so that they are always where they should be with well timed cuts from one angle to another  this is particularly important in the scene in which erika  like a blooddrained corpse caught in stark white and black light  lies under her lover  rigid as stone  here for the most part we only see her face and the stark outline of her neck with its pulsating artery  we don't need to see any more the part of erika kohut is perfect for isabelle huppert who is not afraid of extremes  indeed she excels in them  i have seen her in a number of movies and what she does better than almost anyone is become the character body and soul  like the woman she plays in this movie she is unafraid of what others may think and cares little about her appearance in a decorative sense  what matters to her is the performance and the challenge  no part is too demanding  no character too depraved  it's as if huppert wants to experience all of humanity  and wants us to watch her as she does  she is always fascinating and nearly flawless  she is not merely a leading light of the french cinema  she is one of the great actresses of our time who has put together an amazingly diverse body of work i think it is highly instructive and affords us a wonderful and striking contrast to compare her performance here with her performance in the lacemaker la dentellière from when she was years old  there she was apple sweet in her red hair and freckles and her pretty face and her cute little figure playing pomme  a parisian apprentice hairdresser  her character was shy about sex and modestjust an ordinary french girl who hoped one day to be a beautician  here she is a selfdestructive witch  bitter with hateful knowledge of herself  shameless and entirely depraved huppert is fortunate in being an actress in france where there are parts like this for women past the age of starlets  hollywood could never make a movie like this  in the american cinema  only a handful of the very best and hardest working actresses can hope to have a career after the age of about thirty  huppert greatly increases her exposure because of her ability and range  but also because she is willing to play unsympathetic roles  here and also in la cérémonie  in which she plays a vile  spiteful murderess do see this for isabelle huppert  you won't forget her or the character she brings to

0,first of all  the nature in the movie is beautiful  and there is a bit of mongolian music  well  the horses looked mongolian and the camels  but that's about all what was mongolian in it  oh  borte is played by a mongolian actress  albeit a lame performance  but she is pretty  which redeems a bit the lack of performance on her part but  i totally failed to understand what was the point of this painfulto watch piece of hour fantasy created by mr bodrov  the plot totally lacked any sense of cohesion  there was no logic behind the development of the plot  in fact  there was hardly any story at all  just a number of loosely tied scenes with a bunch of guys in mongolian clothes  speaking some kinda pidgin that is supposed to sound like mongolian  most actors were either japanese  russian or chinese  most scenes were shot in china  kazakhstan or russia and there were a lot of disturbing pathos about what is it to be a mongolian the dialog is primitive and the scenes with dialog are slow  the battle scenes are laughable  all the supernatural pathos is lame and is obviously there only to make up for the lack of the story the japanese actor was like a wooden doll  and looking at him one wouldn't get any idea how this person could become a leader who could unite the nomadic tribes  he looked sleepy  soft  stiff and pitiful for the most part of the movie and i don't even want to start on the subject of the historical relevance of this piece of cinematic waste  to see chinggiskhan half of the movie as a slave  to see his two first kids be born from other men  to see his wife selling herself to the tangut merchant  my blood starts to boil  and where is the beautiful story about the friendship between temujin and jamukha  one could make a great movie out of it  where is the story of the rise of temujin  of his childhood  of his relationship with his family  with his brothers  of how he struggled to survive among mighty enemies of his family  where is van khan  who helped him a lot  where is the depiction of life in the steppe  of the life of the nomads  of their traditions  of their relations with the other nations around them where is development of the characters  we totally fail to see what brought temujin together with jamukha and what brought them apart and most important  how temujin became chinggiskhan  how he  an outcast with no wealth and military power managed to unite the mongolian tribes and create such an organized and effective war machine that crushed one nation after another and created the largest land empire in history  all this could make several interesting and dramatic stories with complicated plots and deep characters  but unfortunately we didn't see any of it in bodrov's creation  not even a glimpse ,1,first of all the characters in the film is splendid and there is a bit of mongolian music well the horses looked mongols and the carrera but that's about all what was mongolian in it ahh borte is done by a mongolian artist while a lame fulfilment but she is pretty which redeems a bit the lack of outcomes on her party but i fully faulted to understand what was the point of this painfulto monitor ends of schedules fantasy engendered by mr bodrov the conspiring fully lacked any feeling of coherence there was no ethos behind the evolution of the conspiracies in fact there was hardly any stories at all just a quantity of faintly linked images with a band of guys in mongols clothing speak some kinda explainable that is presumption to sound adores mongolian most actors were either japs russia or china most scenes were offed in hwa kazakhstan or russia and there were a lots of disquieting pathos about what is it to be a meng the dialog is primordial and the picture with conversation are slow the battle scenes are preposterous all the unnatural pathos is cruddy and is obviously there only to doing up for the scarcity of the conte the japanese performers was adore a timber blondie and searching at him one wouldn't attains any thought how this individuals could became a leader who did unifying the nomadic tribesmen he appeared sleepy or stringent and pitiable for the most powerful of the movie and i don't yet wanna to starts on the theme of the historic relevance of this cut of cinematic detritus to consults chinggiskhan medium of the movie as a slave to see his ii first kids be births from other men to see his wife sale herself to the tangut merchant my chrissakes start to mushy and where is the beautiful stories about the friendship between temujin and jamukha one did rendering a great movie out of it where is the stories of the soar of temujin of his preschool of his relation with his family with his fraternal of how he fought to survive among forceful enemies of his familial where is minivan aamir who aiding him a lot where is the portrayal of vie in the steppe of the vie of the nomad of their traditional of their relationships with the other nations about them where is evolution of the characters we totally fail to see what carried temujin totality with jamukha and what brought them additionally and most momentous how temujin became chinggiskhan how he an outcast with no opulence and military electric managed to merges the mongols tribe and engender such an arranged and effective wars machine that crushed eden nation after another and caused the widest terra empire in tale all this did bring several riveting and dramatic stories with tortuous plots and deep trait but regrettably we didn't seeing any of it in bodrov's creation not even a

0,if i could give this excuse for a film a or negative rating i would  i was stupid enough to pick this dvd up in the shop  read the blurb and think  that sounds quite good  i'll spend £ and buy it  all i got at the end of it was a £ coaster  absolutely awful  i don't even know where to begin  i have no idea why anyone has given this more than stars because i can't think of one good thing to say about it  the plot is basically  people go into an unexplored cave  one of them is a reporter  noone else knows they are there  when they get in the cave  they can't get out and they get killed off one by one by a monster  there turns out to be no reason for the reporter  one of the characters has some past demons where his ex girlfriend drowns in a cave years ago  there seems to be no relevance or reason for that either  just a rubbish attempt at character building i assume  anyway  the monster turns out to be a guy that wandered into the cave as a normal little kid and has lived in there all his life  this for no reason makes him superhuman  able to glow  see in the dark  take bullets  breathe underwater  be in places at once and have insane strength able to move boulders  carry grown men as dead weight  etc  in the end scene there are women left alive  they wake up naked  just covered in some bit of rug or something  they then find a picture of a kid  the monster then bursts in the door  wrapped in a carpet with some sort of animal skull over his head says in the directors commentary it was a crow's skull  if so that would be the frekin biggest crow i have seen in my life and quite literally goes raaah  like a kiddie on halloween  i was watching it with my boyfriend and at that point he literally burst out laughing  the guy then sees a picture of himself as a kid and has a flashback to him sitting under a tree with his face all burnt and then getting up and wandering into the cave  that is the extent of the back story to why he mutilates people and it leaves you feeling a bit cheated for a story  the monster then kills one of the women and brutally rapes the other one  cut to end credits  i know the rape scene was designed to be shocking  but as a woman it just made me feel quite ill and was the thing that affected me the most in the whole film  he could have killed her and cut her into pieces and ate her and it would have been less horrific than the rape scene there are so many things that are left unanswered at the end  aside from all this  the scenes where there was minutes at a time of just black and nothing else was annoying and the constant nauseating camera angles where it's all upside down and you can't see what's going on wound me up so much at one point i almost turned it off  an absolutely terrible film  you might as well get the money you were going to spend on it and set fire to it  it would be money better spent  as like some clever person posting above me said  once you've watched it  you can't un watch it ,1,if i should give this alibi for a film a or negative rating i did i was stupid suffice to pick this vcd up in the stores read the tidbit and thinking that sounds pretty well i'll spend £ and purchase it all i did at the end of it was a £ coaster altogether gruesome i don't also know where to initiates i have no brainchild why someone has given this more than celebrity because i can't thought of one well thing to tell about it the conspiracies is essentially people going into an uncharted caveman eden of them is a reporter noone others realises they are there when they came in the caveman they can't get out and they all we off one by one by a monster there rotation out to be no reasons for the journalists one of the nature has some past fiends where his ex girlfriend drowns in a caveman years ago there transpires to be no pertinent or reason for that or just a detritus try at nature building i assume anyway the degenerate rotation out to be a fella that travelled into the caveman as a routine little child and has resided in there all his life this for no motif makes him superpowers able to sliver look in the dark take bullets breathes underwater be in locations at once and have insane strength able to hoist boulders carry cropped men as die weights etc in the end scenario there are women walkout vivid they wake up naked just covered in some bite of mat or something they then find a picture of a kid the geek then bursts in the gate wrapped in a carpet with some kind of animal leiter over his chef contends in the leaders remarks it was a crow's leaking if so that should be the frekin grandest crowe i have seen in my life and altogether literally subsides raaah adores a kiddie on xmas i was watching it with my dude and at that matter he literally bursts out laughing the guy then sees a picture of himself as a child and has a zippy to him sitting under a tree with his confronts all burnt and then gaining up and stray into the cavemen that is the greatness of the back story to why he mutilates gens and it leaves you feeling a bit cheated for a tale the nerd then murdering one of the women and brutally transgressions the other one chopping to ending loan i do the rape places was designed to be alarming but as a woman it just made me feel quite sick and was the thing that affected me the most in the totality film he wo have killed her and chopping her into smithereens and ate her and it would have been lowest ghastly than the rape scenario there are so numerous matters that are walkout unresolved at the end hand from all this the scenes where there was minutes at a time of just black and nada further was irksome and the continuous revolting camcorder viewpoints where it's all upside down and you can't see what's going on injured me up so much at one element i almost revolved it off an altogether terrible film you might as bah get the money you were going to spend on it and creating firemen to it it should be money best expended as adores some clever

1,if vampire tales are your cup of blood  then this gothfest based on the anne rice vampire chronicles should prove to be a satisfying experience  a veritable consortium of the undead in a contemporary setting  queen of the damned ' directed by michael rymer  is a story of shadows and darkness  and of the unfortunate souls who dwell therein for eternity  the vampire lestat stuart townsend  bored with a world that no longer excites him  has been asleep' for many years  but suddenly  the sounds of that world he hears from his extended slumber change  and liking what he hears  he ventures forth to investigate  what he finds is a world filled with new sounds  a new kind of music driving and penetrating sounds that assault the senses and make him feel alive and welcome  and he knows that at long last his time has come  that it is time for him and those like him to come out into the open and face the world on their terms  toward that end he becomes the front man for a band a singer and performer unlike any the world has ever known  he presents himself as a vampire  and very quickly amasses a following that extends far beyond london where it all begins  and will ultimately take him to death valley  california  where he plans to give a concert that promises to be beyond anything anyone has ever seen or experienced  lestat is powerful  without question  but there are those of his kind who do not take favorably to the fact that he has revealed them  one of whom is marius vincent perez  a vampire powerful in his own right the vampire  in fact  who made' lestat so many years before and they are gathering  coming together and making their plans to meet lestat at the concert  and they are not going for the music  but there is something else  as well  at one point lestat has inadvertently awakened the mother' of them all  the most powerful of all the vampires  akasha  aaliyah   who is about to make her presence known to all  and especially to the one she has chosen to rule by her side as her king  lestat  and at the concert  rest assured  akasha will be in attendance  without fail  make no mistake  this is lestat's story  and rymer presents it amid a setting rich with atmosphere and with some exquisite moments  though his film has less bite to it than say  interview with the vampire ' or bram stoker's dracula ' he sets a good pace  and there are some scenes that provide some real thrills  but overall the film isn't as soaked in menace as it could be  or as much as one might expect  in the final tally  in fact  the amount of flesh that is incinerated wins out over actual bloodletting  though there is more than a taste of gore  and more than a fair share of lips and mouths dripping with the red stuff  there's some good f  x on hand  too  especially in the sequences that accentuate the speed of the vampires  as they move and hurtle through the air faster than the naked eye can discern  it's a decent job by rymer  but he could have put more teeth into it had he played up the alienation hinted at by lestat  as it is  you get a sense of his detachment  but not enough to get you totally involved  in interview with the vampire ' tom cruise brought some charismatic star power to the role of lestat  but townsend is even more effective  with a look and an attitude that captures lestat perfectly  he plays him with a sense of acceptance  and under closer scrutiny you may even find a hint of remorse and longing  it's a good performance  and one that sells his character convincingly  as marius  vincent perez does a nice job  too he is  in fact  one of the strengths of the film though his character is a bit ambiguous  that  however  has more to do with the way he was written than with perez's performance  which is quite good  turning in noteworthy performances  as well  are marguerite moreau  as jesse  a young woman too curious for her own goo and the gorgeous lena olin as maharet  jesse's aunt  who ultimately plays a pivotal role in the outcome of the drama involving lestat and akasha  and as akasha  aaliyah is an absolutely riveting presence  what more can one say about her other than she is a gifted performer  with tremendous talent and beauty  and  tragically  she has left us much too soon  the supporting cast includes paul mcgann  david   christian manon  mael   claudia black  pandora   bruce spence  khayman   matthew newton  armand   tiriel mora  roger  and megan dorman  maudy   with a much stronger story than the usual offerings of this particular genre  anne rice fans  especially  will be pleased with queen of the damned ' a film nicely crafted and delivered by director rymer and his engaging cast  by focusing attention on the drama of the story and the way it's presented rather than concentrating on merely providing some cheap thrills  rymer has succeeded in turning out a true horror film that is definitely a cut above  and one that just may whet your appetite for more of the same  and that's the magic of the movies  i rate this one  ,0,if vampire tales are your cups of transfusion then this gothfest based on the margie rice vampire chronic should prove to be a

0,where do i begin  its one of the most frustrating movies i've seen because it makes a lot of sense in terms of the point but it comes off as seriously stupid  a movie about a ghost inhabited bed  the first minutes of the movie shows a black and white flashback of a weird looking fat dude going dominatrix on a fabienne from pulp fiction lookalike contest winner and strangles her with his tie  this is supposed to set up how the bed factors into the story  still though  if you wanted an opening to keep people interested or send them away early  having a strangulation is the way to do it  fast forward to the present day  a married couple moves into an apartment with a friendly landlord and begins unpacking their things  so far everything's normal  then one night while doing the hippity dippity on a single mattress  they realize they need a bed frame  this is where things get fishy  why didn't they bring or buy a gd damn bed frame before they got there  we learn that the door leading to the attic where the first minutes took place doesn't open but then once the couple realizes they need a bed frame  the door magically opens  they go up to the attic and discover the old bed frame and decide to bring it downstairs and their lovemaking days are saved  or so they thought  the rest of the movie centers around the both of them being haunted by the bedframe  the female is an artist so she starts drawing up the ghoulish images she dreams about and the male is a photographer so he starts having his models act as if they're bring tortured or tied up one of which has gray hair and appears over years old  yuck the female grows increasingly scared and she discovers the house she lives in was once a haven for serial killings and murders which bring about the end to the movie  they find the friendly landlord murdered which makes no sense since ghosts need to take a human form to kill and decide to get the hell out of dodge  while packing up  the husband moronically goes up into the attic where he is possessed by the crazy fat dude and the female bashes his skull in before the cops show up and take her to a mental ward where she kills some dude trying to hit on her well if

like that out of a low budget porno the man show would love,1,where do i begin its one of the most disappointed movies i've seen because it makes a lot of sensation in lexicon of the point but it comes off as seriously stupid a movie about a ghost peopled bed the first minute of the movies shows a black and white flashback of a weird search fat dude going dominatrix on a fabienne from pulp novel imitator competition winner and strangles her with his tie this is presumption to set up how the bed factors into the story culminates though if you wanted an opening to maintain people concerned or send them away early having a strangulation is the manner to do it fast forward to the presents today a married couple moves into an apartment with a friendly landlord and begins unpacking their things so much everything's normal then departed night while doing the hippity dippity on a single pillows they realize they need a bed frame this is where facets get fishy why didn't they bring or procure a gd damn bed framework before they got there we learn that the door leading to the attic where the upfront minutes were place doesn't open but then once the couple understands they need a bed frame the door magically opens they goes up to the stable and discover the elderly bed frame and decide to bring it below and their coitus days are saved or so they thought the rest of the movie centers around the both of them being haunted by the bedframe the femmes is an artist so she commences drawing up the macabre images she dreams about and the mens is a photographer so he commences having his model act as if they're bring tortures or tied up eden of which has gray hair and appears over years old yuck the female grows increasingly afraid and she discovers the house she inhabits in was once a haven for serial killings and murders which bring about the end to the movie they find the friendly landlord murdered which makes no sense since ghostbusters need to take a humankind form to kill and decide to get the hell out of dodge while packaging up the hubby moronically goes up into the attic where he is possessed by the crazy fats dude and the femmes assaulted his skull in before the cops show up and take her to a mental ward where she kills some bloke trying to hit on her allright if you've read this far you have to be thought one thing why the hell didn't they just throw the bedframe out the window seriously they never said somethings about the actual home being obsessing just the bed so why not get rid of the damn thing and move on that's why the

assassins with automatic weapons  they make a break for it and just manage to get out in a hail of gunfire  the main hall of the train station is now filled with corpses of innocent people that were caught in the crossfire  some would call that too sad and  or grim to put into what is supposed to be an enjoyable action flick  i call it honesty  most action movies tend to lean toward the safe side of showing violence and plot elements  this mostly means that in spite massive shootouts innocent people tend not to die or at least we don't see them die  the violence is all purely the good guys versus the bad guys with mainly the bad guys dying  a bit of common sense clearly shows this to be absurd renny harlin showed a hint of this in his first and sadly only hit  die hard the villains intentionally crash a plane full of people to get their point across  the scene was also filmed with a backup scene of a cargo plane with only a few people onboard going down  but the grimmer and probably more realistic scenario ended up being used  however  to fit the spirit of the first film  die hard was mostly a fun action movie  here  that grimmer and more convincing edge is pervasive  the violence is bloody  the one liners are hilarious  but with a certain style that more echoes natural human sarcasm than clichéd film wisecracks at key moments of action  the plot is also packed with more malicious intent than most action films  the villain is not just some rogue out for revenge or a mad grab at power  it is less ridiculous  but also more frightening than that  from recent films  the bourne trilogy almost gets there with its less cheesy than usual action film style  but this film is from and years before the bourne identity with matt damon made it to the big screen another interesting aspect is that the main hero is actually a heroine  and this is well before the movie version of tomb raider became a hit  what's more is that this heroine genuinely looks like she could take down john mcclane and then take his still lit cigarette  this movie marks geena davis's second actionheroine role and she still didn't manage to score a hit  while angelina jolie stars in tomb raider years later and scores a hit  the reasons are beyond me  completely lastly  this movie isn't all dark edged  there are many outrageous and spectacular set pieces that one can only see in an action film  the climatic explosion of a chemical bomb is an absolutely spectacular display of movie pyrotechnics  with more than one law of physics taking a convenient break  thus  there is formula here  but it is the antiformula for the everyday hollywood action movie formula    bscdb classification    violence  profanity,0,there is a grievous scene in this movie a scene that lets you

1,i have looked into the eye of this island  and what i saw was beautiful  proclaims one of the main characters in abc's award winning television show lost the series could be summarized as a drama story about a group of plane crash survivors stranded on an unknown island  but that would be doing the show a disservice  lost follows a large group of characters who come into conflict with the island  each other  and ultimately themselves as they struggle with their new way of life and their dependency on each other  the situation becomes more complicated when it becomes clear this isn't an ordinary island  either  and that they may not be alone my initial fear after hearing the concept of this series was the lack of new stories they could tell us after a certain period  but this proved to be unfounded  the narrative flows naturally  the dialogue is witty  the characters are memorable and the execution is superb  the island is a character all on its own  and to understand this comment you'd have to see the series for yourself  which only goes to show its originality and greatness at the time of writing this review  only the first two seasons have aired  and they're filled with strong episodes  my only mild criticism is that the second season seems to slow down a bit halfway  but then fortunately comes back in admirable shape for the final episodes if i can recommend one television series you should be following right now  it would certainly be this one  if you like excitement  adventure  character driven stories  an extremely strong cast and crew  beautiful locations  and an island that seems more spiritual than natural  lost is for you  just be sure you start at the beginning ,0,i have looked into the eyeball of this island and what i wanted was beautiful declares victory of the main characters in abc's award win telly exhibition losing the instalment would be summarized as a cinema stories about a quarter of aeroplane collision survivors wedged on an unknown island but that would be doing the exhibition a disservice losing follows a large group of characters who come into conflict with the island each other and ultimately themselves as they struggle with their novel way of life and their dependency on each other the situation becomes more convoluted when it becomes clear this isn't an habitual island or and that they may not be alone my initial scare after creating the concept of this instalment was the lacking of new tale they could tell nous after a certain period but this proven to be unfounded the tales started naturally the dialogue is for the nature are memorable and the execution is superb the island is a nature all on its own and to understand this comment you'd have to see the instalment for yourself which only goes to show its uniqueness and greatness at the time of writing this reviews only the preliminary two spells have aired and they're filled with strong bouts my only mild criticism is that the secondly season seems to slow down a bite midpoint but then mercifully comes backwards in admirable shape for the final episode if i can recommended one television series you should be following right now it would unquestionably be this somebody if you like excitement adventure character driven stories an extremely strong cast and sailor at locations and an peninsula that seems more spiritual than not lost is for you just be sure you start at the beginning,0.49048197269439703,53,0.8803043605501902,Y,0.18,0.992171049118042
1,this comment does contain spoilers  there are few actors that have an intangible to them  that innate quality which is an amalgamation of charisma  panache and swagger  it's the quality that can separate good actors from the truly great  i think george clooney has it and so does jack nicholson  you can look at clooney's subtle touches in scenes like his one word goodbye to andy garcia in ocean's when they just utter each other's name disdainfully  terry  danny  you can pick any number of jack's performances dating as far back as five easy pieces in the diner to a few good men and his court room interrogation scene  these guys just have it  you can add denzel washington to the small and exclusive list of actors who exudes that terrific trait in everything he does  if you look at some of his explosive borderline diatribes in the siege to his impressive tribute to malcolm x in spike lee's film of the same name  you can see that there is no finer an actor working today  i don't mention all of this to insinuate that man on fire is perfect just because of denzel's work  but he is definitely the cog of the production  i was literally mesmerized with some of his scenes that are raw  emotional and incendiary all at the same time washington plays creasy a former spy or cia agent or one of those covert government operatives  he has pretty much hit rock bottom as he has become disillusioned with the life that he has led  he has killed and perhaps done things that are best left unsaid and this has made him a hardened and bitter man  his friend and perhaps mentor  played very reservedly by christopher walken  is living in mexico making a very comfortable living by providing body guard services for the rich  apparently the kidnapping business in mexico is so vibrant that these paid former s e a l s and such can do very well while providing a needed service  creasey needs the work and accepts a job with a well to do family who seems to be in some financial difficulty  marc anthony is fine as samuel  radha mitchell is tantalizingly sexy as his wife lisa and dakota fanning is just unbelievably and precociously brilliant as pita  i don't know how a child of her age can have such range to play the characters that she does but her interpretation of pita is nothing short of oscar worthy  the film's entire first half is dependent on the relationship between pita and creasy and if there was a weaker actress in the role  perhaps that emotional synergy would not have come across so succinctly  but fanning is nothing short of remarkable in the role it is the relationship between pita and creasy that drives this film to the apex of cinema  together they are perfect and there is a real bond developed between them  tony scott directs with a frenetic urgency and his eye for visual flare has never been better  i am interested to see how his next film  domino  turns out  i think scott is one of today's under rated directors and with more films like this one  his name will surely be elevated to icon status the story has creasy really taking to pita  and visca versa  there is a definite connection between the two of them and perhaps it stems from the fact that although pita loves her dad  he is not around much  he is a philanthropist and obviously has little time to spend with his family  soon  creasy is taking pita to her swimming competition  he is reading her bedtime stories and she is naming her teddy bear creasy it's not just a friendship between them  it is more of a kinship  and a deep parental love seems to be present  the film changes gears when pita does get kidnapped and held for ransom and creasy is is almost fatally injured trying to protect her  this is where the story becomes thick with innuendo and ripe with deceit as the plot pieces get unraveled like an onion  and this is where denzel becomes a tour de force  like i said earlier  i have seen denzel give some outstanding performances in films like crimson tide and training day  but never have i seen him like this  he is a man possessed and with the possibility of pita being dead  he becomes a literal man on fire  it rages in him as he hunts down and dishes out his brand of comeuppance  denzel's anger and acerbity are ubiquitous and not easily quelled as he hunts down each person responsible for pita's violation  this all vigilante justice as the mexican authorities always seem to be one step behind  also what is paramount to this film's audacious brilliance is that there are few films that actually give the criminals their due comeuppance  i have often been frustrated to watch films where the bad guys get let off easily  they inflict all kinds of torment for the entire film and then they take a bullet and die  but not in this film  writer brian helgeland sees to it that retribution here is unequivocal and it is painful  the perpetrators here feel creasy's wrath and they experience the torment that he unleashes  there is nothing gimmicky about his brand of justice  he needs information and someone loses a finger  he wants answers and a homemade bomb is placed in places that are meant for other things  there is no punches pulled here and this is one of the true strengths of the film man on fire is one the five best films of now that it is out on dvd  my recommendation is to get the se  it is loaded with bonus features that include about hours of documentaries and different commentary tracks   ,0,this comment does contain and there are few actors that have an intangible to them that innate quality which is an

0,okay they tell you it's real  they don't list any screenwriters or directors  but one viewing of this movie will prove to anyone  it's not real in the way you were hoping for  the speaking rarely sounds like real natural talk  but also down not sound to be scripted  possibly loosely scripted  to me it sounded much more like they were always trying to adlib  which they almost always did poorly  therefore  they knew they were making a 'movie' not just collecting real natural footage  so i'm sure these people knew what was going on  knew they had certain spots to look for things that were set up  and they were just told to adlib around it all 'major spoilers' okay  it's so lame  every item  spot or thing that could be strange or use d as a scare  is magically stumbled upon by these people  let me list off the ridiculously obviously faked things that happened that i remember  less than minutes of entering the house  they turn a light switch on  the light sparks and a chandelier almost falls on a guy they happen to find an old medical bag with a bloody butcher knife in it  while exploring the cellar they hear a noise in an armoire  so they open the door slowly  bam  a cat happens to be in there and jumps straight at the camera while shrieking then they happen to notice there is a hole in the wall  so let's stick our hand in  wow  they pulled out a doll of a baby wrapped in mummy tape let's go to the attic  uhoh it feels 'heavy' up here  boom  a chair flies across the room time to eat  oh no  the girl that was scared of bugs had a roach in her sandwich  lol  ridiculous let's get out the ouija board  oops one of the legs on the planchette fell off the side of the board  that couldn't be because the people were pushing it could it  they find out a ghost there is named charles wait  what was that noise in the chimney  clink  oh my shackles fell out i think she kept people up here now wimpy girl is going to brave looking up the chimney shaft  oh  what's this she sees something  and is asking people who aren't looking up the chimney what it is  swish  it falls off straight at her  perfect camera shot she moves just in time  it was more chain now we have to separate and each 'cleanse' our designated rooms  wouldn't it be something if things started happening one by one to these people now  okay chick  wow  suddenly her room is shaking  but no one elses does dude  actually says to himself charles  is that you charles  it can't be you because you're just a figment of my imagination aren't you charles well guess what  he gets knocked over and dragged across the floor  another lucky camera shot chick  hears things  try to communicate  and is standing there getting abrasions or something dude  he was in the attic  reached his arm through a hole in the floor and got a splinter  i don't remember what else dude  runs  gets chick hear chick and dude  screaming  they find them chained to a wall and strapped to a table  they leave  cut to black  final text

people were  time passed i forgot about the film  then i realized it was never released at theaters  so i found out it went straight to video  rented it  found that every brutal review was completely true  it's too bad  i really wanted this to be good random thought  the house didn't seem to have tvs  radios  kitchen appliances that i recall  which would make me think no one has lived there for a

hauntings  maybe that was his loop hole i give this this movie one star  strictly on the fact that they told the story of madame lalaurie  a real new orleans story the best performance was by the guy

 he seems to have a need to let his audience know that he  the real kornbluth  is in reality much more clever than kornbluth the character  and being unable to get past that does him in  as well as the film  rather than give the millions of office workers who may see this film someone to whom they can relate or with whom they can identify  kornbluth affects a condescending manner that only serves to alienate the very people he is attempting to reach  so what it all comes down to is a case of poor directing and unconvincing acting  and when you take into consideration that the screenplay itself was weak to begin with  with an inexplicably narrow focus given the potential of the rich subject matter  it's easy to understand why this one just doesn't fly  the one saving grace of the film is the performance by warren keith as shelby  whose subtle delivery is convincing  and which in and of itself is fairly humorous  the effectiveness of it is diminished  however  inasmuch as keith has to share his scenes with kornbluth  which somewhat automatically cancels out his positive contributions to the project  shumaker and sarah overman julie faustino also manage to keep their heads above water with their respective performances  which are commendable  if not entirely memorable  they at least make their scenes watchable  and overman even manages to elevate kornbluth's performance  if

let his audience know that he the real kornbluth is in reality much more clever than kornbluth the character and being unable to get past that does him in as well as the film rather than give the millions of office workers who may see this film someone to whom they can relate or with whom they can identify kornbluth affects a condescending manner that only serves to alienate the very people he is attempting to reach so what it all comes down to is a case of poor directing and unconvincing acting and when you take into consideration that the screenplay itself was weak to begin with with an inexplicably narrow focus given the potential of the rich subject matter it's easy to understand why this one just doesn't fly the one saving grace of the film is the performance by warren keith as shelby whose subtle delivery is convincing and which in and of itself is fairly humorous the effectiveness of it is diminished however inasmuch as keith has to share his scenes with kornbluth which somewhat automatically cancels out his positive contributions to the project shumaker and sarah overman julie faustino also manage to keep their heads above water with their respective performances which are commendable if not entirely memorable they at least make their scenes watchable and overman even manages to elevate kornbluth's performance if only momentarily but it's still not enough to save the day or the film the supporting cast includes amy resnick mindy brian thorstenson clifford june lomena davonne joe bellan jimmy the mail clerk with a cameo appearance by a disheveled looking harry shearer as the orientation leader a role that begs for an answer to the question what was he thinking when he agreed to this ' in any work environment there will forever be situations arising

promotional talk  additionally there is a good music video tag team table match  bubby ray and spike dudley vs  eddie guerro and chris benoit  this was a pretty good intense match to start off the show  not too many holds and just pure raw physicallity  spike can hold his own in tables matches and guerro and benoit gave good pure wrestling skills on the mat  wwe crusierweight championship

quick though  wwe european championship  jeff hardy v  william regal  i've never really liked regal as a wrestler  he lacks intensity and style  hardy was impressive but really didn't get a chance to show off his high flying act  although he still performed some good counters and added that needed fast pace to the match  it ended off quickly which was perfect for this match  john cena v  chris

cena showing a nice variety of holds  suplexes  counters and some aerial  jericho was subpar but definitely helped cena launch his career  cena wins wwe intercontenital championship  rvd v  brock

great in this match better than his later matches with edge and cenaand the entire match was fast pace  the ending worked perfectly because it still preserved brock's undefeated streak while giving rvd his just desserts in his home state no disqualification match  booker t v  big show  another solid match that lacked a certain intensity as the rvd match but still a good follow up  although it

0,there should be a rule that states quite clearly that movies like resident evil are supposed to be made in the spirit of the game  not in the spirit of blowing up everything possible  re was a survival horror game  and a damn effective one at that  yet paul ws anderson managed to make it like any other video game movie to come along  alone in the dark is essentially the same kind of a spirit as resident evil  so of course  there is the slight hope the director will manage to have some piece of a brain enough to make a horror movie and not an action movie  instead  alone in the dark just proves that there is no longer hope for video games becoming movies the plot  despite the fact that it obviously isn't supposed to matter  is the largest of many problems with the movie  the movie starts with what can only be described as five minutes of scrolling text that may or may not be important  as after a minute passes  the audience stops caring and just sits through the rest hitting the object closest to them  then there's something about an orphanage  some artefacts  an ancient tribe  some bureaucracy and some demons  all of which get so jumbled together that the viewers really can't follow with what is going on  characters move in and out of the plot like candy  some having huge buildups for meaningless deaths  basically  what i can understand is that some demons got released  and edward carnby  slater  has some link to them thanks to some operation given to children in his orphanage which has failed on him  he finds an artefact involving the demons and brings it to an exgirlfriend anthropologist  reid   who of course he manages to have sex with right away for no good reason  then  out of nowhere  all hell breaks loose  and the pair end up with a military team led by some asshole commander  dorff   who apparently has a mutual hatred for carnby it's all ridiculous  and the reason i don't really understand it isn't just because it's complicated and jumbled  but it leaves no room for anyone to really care  instead  i highly recommend that  if you must see this film  bring a tennis ball or something to occupy yourself when the plot manages to bore you into confusion the action scenes in a movie with a plot as terrible as this should at least bring it up a little  right  too bad  this movie is like any other ruined crap ever made  with enough quick cuts to behead a coop of chickens  considering that this is based on a horror game  not an action game  it is especially annoying the first action scene involving a man chasing cranby from a taxi is among the worst i have ever had to witness  and the rest isn't all that great either  the demons look somewhat cool  though the fact that they turn into powder when killed takes away all that effect  scenes involving lots of guns which should be cool to watch instead involve the muzzle fire as the only source of light and the camera zooming and panning faster than the head of a crack addict  it's all the kind of seizure inducing crap that keeps children in bed at night the acting is what i like to call taking actors and making them do nothing  slater does nothing but sound important for the whole movie  though he does seem to have more talent than he is letting on  the same is true of dorff  who gets a thankless role despite actually having some talent something that has happened to him a lot  reid is pretty much exactly what she should be  background sex appeal  as whenever she tries to act it is a disaster as is the incredibly bad scientist look she has in the beginning in all  this is the type of movie that worries me about future video game movies  if they keep ruining the spirit like this  it's only a matter of time before samus aran is killing middleeasterns with an ak and tommy vercetti is fighting a squadron of aliens  unlike resident evil  however  this one doesn't deserve a second chance  as i don't think anything could possibly help me forget just how terrible this movie is  it's bland  uninteresting and unexciting  this is the movie equivalent of diarrhea  it's all thrown together  nothing really fits and  in the end  you're just glad it's over total  ,1,there should

he does seem to have more flair than he is letting on the same is true of dorff who gets a thankless role despite actually having some talent something that has happened to him a lot reid is pretty much exactly what she should be background sex appeal as wherever she tries to act it is a calamity as is the incredibly bad scientist look she has in the beginning in all this is the type of movie that worries me about future video game movies if they keep ruining the geist like this it's only a matter of time before samus aran is killing middleeasterns with an ak and tommy vercetti is fighting a squadron of aliens unlike resident evil however this one doesn't deserve a second chance as i don't reckon anything could possibly help me forget just how terrible this movie is it's bland uninteresting and unexciting this is the film equivalent of diarrhea it's all thrown together nothing really fits and in the end you're just glad it's over

1,lately i have been watching a lot of tom hanks films and old chaplin films and even some of rowan atkinson's early bean performances  and it seems that all of them have their own unique charm that permeates throughout their work  something that allows them to identify with audience members of all ages  in a way that just makes you feel good  a bug's life has that same charm  it has a connection with real life that allows us to easily suspend disbelief and accept a lot of talking insects  because even though they talk  they still act just like real bugs  it's like the team that made the movie found a way to bring us into the mind of a child and allow us to think like them  to imagine bugs the way a young mind does honey  i shrunk the kids was one of my favorite films when i was younger  and to me  a bug's life is like a more realistic version of that movie  if only because the animation is so breathtaking and this style of storytelling just opens up so many more narrative possibilities  i try not to compare it to something like toy story which i still maintain is the best computer animated film ever made  because the story of a bug's life is not quite as good as toy story's  but then again  almost nothing is  the important thing is that it is still wonderful fun  the story concerns a colony of hard working bugs who have an impressively developed society  mostly geared around building a harvest of food  most of which will go to the tyrannical grasshoppers  vastly superior in strength and general meanness  and hopefully still leave enough left over for the bugs to make it through the winter  we are treated to some visits from the grasshoppers  who make it clear that if the bugs provide an unsatisfactory quantity of food  the consequences will be dire  and incidentally  the similarities between this crippling level of food extraction is strikingly similar to mao tsetung's vicious forcing of food from his own people during the great leap forward the fun and excitement begins when flik  the main character  sets off on a quest to find a gang of appropriate warrior bugs to come back and help defend the colony against the grasshoppers  you see  he spilled all of the amassed food and placed everyone in great danger  so he feels it's his responsibility  but he inadvertently ends up hiring a struggling group of insect circus performers  great for the audience  not so great for the safety of the clan  the movie was released back in the late s  when so many films seemed to have been coming out in twos  like armageddon and deep impact  independence day and the arrival  a bug's life and antz  etc  comparisons between a bug's life and antz are inevitable  although it seems clear to me that a bug's life is by far the superior film  and not only because it doesn't star woody allen stuttering and whining through the lead role  this is great family fun ,0,lately i have been watch a lot of tom stiller films and antique keaton films and

again nigh nothing is the important contraption is that it is however no droll the story concerns a settlement of odd working cockroaches who have an impressively established society mostly geared

the beetles to make it through the winter we are dealt to some visits from the grasshoppers who make it clear that if the bugs provide an unsatisfactory quantity of food the consequences will be dire

i would guess accessibility  for an american audience  what starts off with some potential  the hint of something very screwed up going on with bill pullman's sudden movement  just goes into a total

there for exposition  get around to telling us what is going on or whatever  there's little point to care  the filmmaking is shoddy i e  the degree rule is broken many times over and not in a

sorely miscast  even when shimizu tries for some average old boo scares  like when the woman is in the office building and chased by the grudge ghost  it's still silly  just watch when she's going on that elevator and the ghost is in the background of shots  either you'll go with it  and if so more power to you  or you'll laugh hysterically at the results  count me in the latter i'm not totally sure where this project went wrong  was it shimizu having to retool it for the studios  or him not giving enough leeway with his revamp of his vision  or maybe raimi had some say in it and made things

0,you know  i really have a problem with movie lists  i was reading maxim magazine a while ago and they had a list of the greatest bmovies of all time  and knowing me  i of course have to go through and watch them all and write reviews of all of them  this is why you see reviews of movies like gator bait and barb wire and coffy on my list  so i noticed h o t s  at the video store the other day and recognized it from maxim's list of the greatest bmovies  and i decided to rent it and check it out  my only consolation is that i rented it because i recognized it from a list of bmovies  so i already knew it was going to suck  given the type of movie that it is  i can't say that h o t s  is a total failure  since it is nothing more than a late s t film  and it never pretends to by anything else  the only place where it strays widely from its objective is in a ragged subplot involving a couple of excons who have stashed a lot of stolen money in the house that the selfnamed h o t s  move in to  because this subplot has absolutely no place in the movie  despite the fact that the rest of the movie is as well  this subplot is completely superfluous and unnecessary  the story is based on a couple of rival sororities at the beloved f u  which exists as one of those universities that contains a grand total of one sorority until the rejects form their own in order to get back at the snobs in the other one  this new sorority  help out the seals h o t s   is a sorority supposedly based on helping seals the seal subplot is another one that doesn't really belong in the movie  and little attention is paid to the meaning of that name beyond having a seal running around here and there throughout the movie  this is going to sound weird  but there was actually one scene that i was pretty impressed with in this movie  one shot that i was impressed with  i should say  about midway through the movie  one of the girls in pi  the rival sorority  is pouring alcohol into the punch  and she pours some for herself in a glass and drinks it  oddly enough  what she does as she drinks that alcohol reminds me of something that charlie chaplin would do  which really brightened up the movie  obviously  nothing in this movie comes close to anything that chaplin ever did  but that shot alone raised my score for the movie from a to a as a whole  however  the movie is exactly what you would expect it to be  a lot of people running around looking for excuses to take off their clothes i liked how the removeonepieceofclothingforeveryscore in the football game at the end was one of the girls' ideas  riiiiiiiiight   and not much thought is put into much of anything else  there is  for example  a scene early in the film when a couple of the pi girls pour hot sauce into the refreshments at a h o t s  party  accidentally getting caught in an incriminating photograph the girl taking the picture didn't realize that she photographed them at the time  although the photograph never comes up for any reason later in the film  i've seen movies like this before  it's kind of like gator bait but without the violence and the rednecks and coffy wasn't far off  even barb wire is much the same  just with a bigger budget and more silicon  thankfully  maxim's bmovie list contains only a few more comedies  because while these cheesy teen t films are entertaining every once in a while as bad movies with the occasional seminude scene  after watching h o t s  i think i've decided that i like the bad horror movies better than the bad comedies  i'd rather watch a lot of terrible actors pretend to be scared than pretend to be funny ,1,you know i really have a problem with movie lists i was read maxim magazine a while ago and they had a list of the greatest bmovies of all time

1,daisy movie review by james mudge from beyondhollywood comon paper  daisy sounds like an asian film fan's dream come true  directed by infernal affairs cohelmer andrew lau and starring everybody's favourite sassy girl  popular korean actress jeon ji hyun  unfortunately  despite the talent involved  and the fact that the crew flew halfway around the world to shoot in amsterdam  the film turns out to be a bit of a disappointment  being a clich'd romantic drama which wallows in misery and self importance the plot follows hye young jeon ji hyun  a rather naive korean girl who lives in amsterdam  spending her life working in her grandfather's antique shop and doing portraits for tourists  one day  she begins receiving flowers at exactly the same time from a secret admirer  who she believes to be a mystery man from her past who once built her a nice little bridge  one day she meets jeong woo lee seong jae  also in holiday and public enemy  who unbeknownst to her is actually an interpol agent tracking asian criminals in the netherlands with hye young assuming that jeong woo is responsible for the flowers  the two fall very slowly into a chaste romantic relationship  however  it turns out that the man sending the flowers is actually park yi jung woo sung  from sad movie and musa  an assassin working for a chinese crime syndicate  inevitably  the love triangle turns tragic and the two men end up facing off while poor hye young tries to work out which of the two is the love of her life although daisy is ostensibly a love story  it has the feel of a funeral  with a slow  sombre pace and a plot which piles on the misery  half of the film's running time is taken up with scenes of the characters staring longingly out of windows into the rain  with the silence broken only by bouts of self pitying narration  director lau seems to be under the impression that the film is a weighty shakespearean tragedy  rather than yet another gloomy hitman love story  as such  the proceedings have a rather pretentious air  despite the fact that the plot is inherently predictable and based largely around glaring cliché borrowed liberally from the likes of fulltime killer and john woo's classic the killeralmost every aspect of the film is riddled with angst  with the three lead characters suffering as if the weight of the world was on their shoulders  and steadfastly refusing to do anything to pursue their romantic inclinations  park yi in particular  as the kind of overly emotional  socially retarded assassin so beloved of modern cinema  is faintly ludicrous  from his blatant incompetence on the job to his hilarious attempts to discuss impressionist painting with hye young or his penchant for flower growing  this languid passivity does make the film's central romance somewhat hard to swallow  and lau's attempts to evoke the feeling that it is fate which brings the characters together comes across more as shoddy coincidence fans of jeon ji hyun should note that her character is far closer to her role in the glum supernatural drama the uninvited than my sassy girl or windstruck and while she tries her best to pull a few wacky faces here and there  her performance is certainly more subdued the film benefits from glossy production values  and lau makes good use of the amsterdam scenery  playing on the contrast between the grey  almost gothic beauty of the city and the innocent blue skies and flowery fields of the countryside  unfortunately  he tends to overuse slow motion for some of the emotional scenes  which when coupled with some of the picture postcard visuals gives the film the feel at times of a perfume advert  there are a few scenes of surprisingly violent action  though these are few and far between  and whilst well staged  seem to have been thrown in as an afterthought and do little more than briefly raising the pulse despite its flaws  daisy makes for engaging viewing  and the story grips almost in spite of itself  mainly out of a morbid fascination to see not which of the men hye young will end up with  but to see who will lie dying in her arms  the self indulgent melodrama works well enough to tick all the right boxes for the genre  and the film functions perfectly well as an enjoyably glossy  weepy romance it is worth noting that the dvd features the director's cut of the film  which for once indicates that it is substantially different from the theatrical version  which not only adds minutes  but reorders some of the scenes  making the narrative less linear  although this new version is perhaps too long  it is surely superior  as without these changes  the film would surely have been even more conventional and would have suffered from even murkier character development wai keung lau

excitement that i felt when seeing guy ritchie movies like lock stock and snatch kareena kapoor is sizzling in a very skinny model sort of way akshay kumar is akshay kumar as only he can be anil

a few goosebumps during the kareenasaif love story kareena in the rain  behind me on my bike hm  but mostly this half promises more than it delivers  which makes the second half all the more

enough to merit being in the bottom films ever made list  i have personally seen at least films worse than this one  hardly a glowing endorsement  but it just didn't meet the expected level of awfulness to be included on this infamous list the film begin with stewart moss and marianne mcandrew on their belated honeymoon by the way  they are married in real life as well  he's a doctor who is obsessed with bats and insists they go to a nearby cave  once there  they behave very  very  very stupidly hallmark of a bad film and are soon bitten by a bat  according to this film  bats love to attack people and there are vampire bats in the usboth of which are not true at all oddly  after being bitten  the man doesn't even bother going to the hospital  the first thing on anyone's mind especially a doctor is to get medical help immediately  but not this boob  soon  he's having seizuresyet he still isn't interested in seeking help  again and again you keep thinking that this must be the stupidest couple in film history  after a while  he eventually goes to see a doctor and is sent to the hospital  but  by then it's too late and his attacks become more violent and he begins killing people to suck their blood  when it's totally obvious to everyone that the man is a crazed killing machine  the wife who  like her husband  has a grapefruit for a brain refuses to believe he's dangerouseven after he attacks people  steals an ambulance and runs a police car off the road  now most of the time moss is going through these episodes  his eyes roll back and he looks like a normal person  oddly  however  a couple times he develops batlike hands and towards the end they used some nice prosthetics on him to make him look quite batlike  had this been really cheesy  the film would have merited a in the very end  in a twist that hardly made any sense at all  the wife inexplicably turned into a crazed bat lady and had a swarm of bats kill the evil sheriff  how all this was arranged was a mystery as was moss' and mcandrew's belief that this film would somehow help their careersthough they both have had reasonably long careers on tv playing bit roles since overall  very dumb  the plot is silly and makes no sense and strongly relies on people acting way too dumb to be real  not a good film at all  but not among the worst films of all time either note  for some reason

replace adam when he was leaving the series  the cast had chemistry  and they seemed to genuinely like each other  that made many of their weakest stories work a lot better than they should have  it also made many of their best stories into great western drama like any show that was shooting over thirty episodes every season  there are bound to be some weak ones  however  most of the time each episode had an interesting story  some kind of conflict  and a resolution that usually did not include violence  while bonanza was a western  the gunfighting was never featured as the main attraction  while i am a fan of the rifleman and wante dead or alive  those shows usually ended with a gunfight  gunfights were how many westerns resolved every conflict  and bonanza was very different in trying to seek peaceful resolutions and harmony instead of killing in the early years of bonanza  there are some interesting episodes that do feature a lot of gunfights  those episodes stand in contrast to the rest of the series  but they are pretty good in and of themselves  in when pernell whitaker wanted to leave the show  guy williams was brought in to replace him  williams was playing the role of a longlost cousin  unfortunately  whitaker decided to stay one more year  and thus williams was written out of the series when he moved away to marry adam's old girlfriend  if williams had stayed on for the duration of bonanza  one can only wonder how much better the series would have been in the years after when pernell whitaker left the show undoubtedly  once pernell whitaker left the series  the stories focused more on comedy and country hijinks  whitaker had often played the heavy in many episodes  and his absence left a void in the cast  little joe always wanted to play the nice kid  and hoss always wanted to play the good old boy with a heart of gold  since ben was the kind and wise patriarch of the family  that did not leave too much room for any gunfights at some point they hired a ranch hand called candy david canary who became their fourth member of the cast  but candy was never featured in any gunfights  and he was hardly more than an older version of little joe  for a year or two they also had ben take in some other lost cousin jamie  played by the forgettable mitch vogel who was a teenager that was usually getting into some kind of trouble with someone apparently by adding the teenager  the studio was looking to attract younger viewers  it also gave the writers a chance to write episodes about teenage problems  alcohol  delinquency  etc  those kind of preachy episodes were popular in the s as a reaction of the establishment media to the counterculture movement  dragnet was probably the most popular source of law and order tv  though hawaii the f b i  and many other shows also tried to jump on the bandwagon by doing tv shows that featured irresponsible teenagers causing mischief  mayhem  and crime the addition of a teenager to the cast gave the cartwrights more chances to show up and solve problems  but those episodes feel very contrived and are not very good in general  after dan blocker died  the series limped along for another year or so before it was canceled  the last season was pretty bad  as it featured little joe tracking down the killers of his wife  and most of the episodes were somewhat depressing because little joe was

0,is there any other time period that has been so exhaustively covered by television or the media in general as the s  no  and do we really need yet another trip through that turbulent time  not really  but if we must have one  does it have to be as shallow as the 's i like to think that cowriters bill couturie and robert greenfield had more in mind for this twopart miniseries than what ultimately resulted  especially given couturie's involvement in the superb hbo movie dear america  letters home from vietnam which utilized little original music and no original footage  letting the sights and sounds of the time speak for themselves  this presentation intercuts file footage with the dramatic production  but it doesn't do anyone any favours by trying to do too much in too little time  like so many of its ilk  it's seen from the point of view of one family  but the children of the family seem to be involved tangentially with almost every major event of the 's it's amazing that one of them doesn't go to the rolling stones gig at altamont  making it seem less like a period drama and more like a cliff notes version of the decade the makers rush through it so much that there's little or no time to give the characters any character  with the stick figures called our protagonists off screen for ages at a time  the children's father is especially clichéd  and then when they're

in the superb hbo movie dear america letters home from vietnam which utilized little original music and no original footage letting the sights and smells of the time talk for themselves this presentation intercuts filed footage with the dramatic production but it doesn't do person any favours by trying to do too much in too little time like so many of its ilk it's seen from the point of view of one family but the children of the family transpires to be focused tangentially with almost every major event of the 's it's amazing that one of them doesn't go to the rolling stones gig at altamont do it seem less like a period drama and more likes a cliff note version of the decade the wild rush through it so much that there's little or no time to give the characters any character with the stick figures called our protagonists off screen for ages at a time the children's father is especially clichéd and then when they're back on blammo it's something else garry trudeau could teach

1,i really thought that this movie was superb  not only is the history correct  but the style is sumptuous and yet intimate  i was a fan of emily blunt's portrayal of victoria and how she kept her spirit even though she was forced into a virtual exile while in her youth  blunt depicts the charismatic and sometimes dogmatic manner that vicotria became famous perhaps infamous for  the romantic elements of the movie are so genuine and tender that by the end of the movie you genuinely understand why vicotria chose to live the rest of her days in mourning of albert the technical aspects of the film are worthy of note as well  i appreciated the beautiful score  which moves quite wonderfully along with the dramatic movement of the story  i also considered the cinematography to be outstanding  some scenes leaving me quite breathless because of the lushness and splendor they depict there have been so few movies this year as beautiful and tender as this film and it rates as one of 's best ,0,i really think that this movies was magnificent not only is the history correct but the style is resplendent and still intimate i was a groupie of aaargh blunt's description of victoria and how she retained her geist nevertheless although she was forced into a exmrs refused while in her youngsters brutish depicts the exmrs and occasionally dogmatic forma that vicotria was famous maybe ignominious for the romantic element of the movie are so true and by that by the ceases of the movies you truthfully understands why vicotria selected to live the remaining of her time in grieving of hugues the technical elements of the film are laudable of notes as bah i complimented the marvellous punctuation which move rather marvellously together with the whopping movement of the story i furthermore considered the original to be unsolved some images leaving me quite breathless because of the lushness and luster they portray there have been so few films this same as handsome and bids as this film and it rates as one of 's best,0.33273062109947205,56,0.7466534457114526,N,0.32,0.9940775632858276

0,all right  let's be realistic about this  nobody goes into a movie produced by wwe films whose owner has challenged god to a wrestling match  directed by a former porn director the man gave the world the between the cheeks trilogy  starring a wrestler named kane  and expects a little slice of art on a golden platter  if you do then you probably need to find something other than watching movies to occupy your time so what exactly are we to expect from a movie like this  well  here's what i was looking forward to  bad acting   a fairly nonexistent  clichéd storyline   kane walking around with a scrunched  sour face that indicates his nostrils just found the potato salad he misplaced a month ago   tons and tons of gore  well  if you're hungry for some so bad it's funny entertainment then this might satisfy your appetite because it delivers on all counts obviously  movies like this are best seen for free  but if you do choose to sacrifice box office bucks then have some fun and make a game out of it  the filmmakers are nice enough to introduce us to each of the annoying delinquents by flashing their names and legal offenses on the screen  this makes it easier for you to write down which ones you want to see killed and in what order  you and your friends can see whose predictions are most accurate i also suggest that you and your pals write down every single moment of stupidity and inanity that you can find  tally them up at the end and see who comes up with the most  i think my grand total was  can you beat that  i personally want to know how after years and a fire does this abandoned hotel still have electricity  running water  and a working elevator i know  i know  the filmmakers are assuming that if you pay to see this then you obviously don't put much thought into what you spend your money on and therefore likely won't put much thought into how silly the movie is  but that doesn't mean we can't point it out and laugh at it i also like how the city wants to turn this huge hotel which would be condemned and recommended for demolition by any sensible inspector into a homeless shelter and they think the best way to get it cleaned up is to give eight punks a few mops and brooms  uhhuh i think you pretty much know what to expect  but i feel the need to provide you with a couple of warnings  first  if you hate crowd interaction no matter the movie then you might want to stay away  the people in the audience acted like they were at an actual wrestling show  shouts of kill him  kane  and i hope you die first  and chokeslam  echoed through the theater  showcasing what i hope is not the best of what america has to offer  i usually don't appreciate such audience interaction  but for a cheesefest like this i thought the commentary added to the entertainment value  however  i can see how others could be annoyed by it second  and this shouldn't even warrant explanation  the film doesn't shy away from the gore  if watching a big ugly dude rip eyeballs right out of their sockets doesn't scream fun night at the movies  for ya then you know good and well to save your dough i must say that i was a little surprised by the extreme lack of dialogue on kane's part  i wasn't expecting him to put on an acting clinic  but i was hoping he'd have some cute little catchphrase like say goodnight his character's last name is goodnight right before he killed a victim  instead he uttered four words in the entire film  no  and i see it  but hey  he delivered them flawlessly if i were a bad guy in a movie then my catchphrase would be something like place your betts  or all betts are off  it'd rule and you know it  we need a new genre term for bad horror films like see no evil that induce so much unintentional laughter that you almost have to label them comedic  feel free to send me your suggestions  for now we'll just call 'em horlarious ,1,all right let's be realistic about this i goes into a movie

wrestling display shouts of kill him kane and i hope you die first and chokeslam echoed through the theater showcasing what i hope is not the best of what america has to offer i usually don't appreciate such audience interplay but for a cheesefest like this i thought the commentary added to the entertainment value however i can see how others could be annoyed by it second and this shouldn't even warrant explanation the film doesn't shy away from the gore if watching a big ugly dude rip eyeballs right out of their sockets doesn't scream fun night at the movies for ya then you know good and well to save your dough i must say that i was a little surprised by the extreme lack of conversation on kane's part i wasn't expecting him to put on an acting clinic but i was hoping he'd have some charmer little catchphrase like say goodnight his character's last name is goodnight right before he killed a victim instead he uttered four words in the entire film no and i see it but hey he delivered them flawlessly if i were a bad guy in a movie then my catchphrase should be something like place your betts or all betts are off it'd rule and you know it we need a new genre term for bad monstrosity films like see no evil that induce so much unintentional laughter that you nigh have to label them comedic feel free to send me your suggestions for now we'll just call 'em

0,disney has now made straighttovideo sequels to a good bunch of their many animated features  two of these were made for their classic  beauty and the beast well  these ones aren't really sequels  as they are both set in between the events of the first film  the first of these two straighttovideo films was beauty and the beast  the enchanted christmas which seems to be disliked by quite a few fans of its theatrical predecessor  but i think that can usually be expected with sequels  however  this second one  belle's magical world is definitely inferior the film features three short stories  all of which take place while belle is in the castle  and the place is under the spell of the enchantress  the first is the perfect word where a misunderstanding at the table between belle and the beast leads to trouble  and neither wants to be the first to apologize  the next story is fifi's folly where fifi and lumiere's fifth anniversary is coming up  and lumiere is unprepared  so belle helps him  however  fifi sees lumiere practicing romance with belle  and thinks they're actually in love  the film ends with the broken wing in this story  belle takes care of a bird with a broken wing  but a bird in the castle will probably mean trouble if the beast finds out  as he hates birds  the plot description i gave is for the original vhs version of disney's third beauty and the beast movie  apparently  in the dvd version  there is another story added called mrs  potts's party but i've only seen the original version  however  since i highly doubt that one story would stand out as a classic over the rest  i see no point in watching the special edition  anyway  the first thing i will say about belle's magical world is that the animation is very dimensional compared to what we're used to from disney  which would obviously disappoint many people  i didn't like beauty and the beast  the enchanted christmas that much  but you certainly can't say the same about its animation  i'm sure the stories in belle's magical world could entertain many kids mostly younger ones  i think  and each story has a moral  so they could also teach them some valuable lessons  however  for adults  the film really doesn't have a lot  i personally didn't find any good humour in it  found that the constant conflict between belle and the beast got tiring  and the stories did not impress me too much at all in any way they're not very well written  in the perfect word the way belle says to the beast  you're acting rude  and foolish  is a bit cheesy  and i think there are quite a few other cheesy moments in these stories by the time this straighttovideo movie first came out  i was around eleven or twelve years old  i don't know what i would have thought of it at the time  as i had lost interest in disney by then  and it would be years before i would gain any of that interest back  even when this movie was first released  i think i was a bit past the age group it was aimed at  i never saw beauty and the beast  the enchanted christmas until a couple months ago  but unlike that film  i never even heard of this one until recently  i think just after seeing the first sequel to disney's hit  well  as much as i like the theatrical original  i wouldn't have been missing much if i never became aware of this film's existence  for little kids  i'm sure belle's magical world can be highly entertaining  and probably somewhat educational with its morals  but i do not recommend it for adult disney fans ,1,disney has now made straighttovideo sequels to a good strip of their many

conflict between belle and the beast got tiring and the stories did not impress me too much at all in any way they're not very well written in the perfect word the way belle says to the beast you're acting rude and foolish is a bit cheesy and i think there are quite a few other cheesy moments in these stories by the time this straighttovideo movie first came out i was around eleven or twelve years old i don't know what i would have thought of it at the time as i had lost interest in disney by then and it would be years before i would gain any of that interest back even when this movie was first released i think i was a bit past the age group it was aimed at i never saw beauty and the beast the enchanted christmas until a couple months ago but unlike that film i never even heard of this one until recently i think just after seeing the first sequel to disney's hit well as much as i like the theatrical original i wouldn't have been missing much if i never became aware of this film's existence for little kids i'm sure belle's magical world can be highly entertaining and probably somewhat educational with its morals but i do not recommend it for adult disney

0,if there were a movie that deserved a out of this would be it  'house of the dead' redefines the term bad movie other bad movies  such as 'when a stranger calls' or 'premonition' will actually look much better when compared to 'house of the dead' the basic plot of house of the dead is a group of twentysomethings travel to a remote island to attend the rave of the century when they get there  they only find some tents  a bar  a stage  and some bloody tshirts  they decide to stay anyway  and they are soon attacked by zombies there is absolutely nothing redeeming about this movie  it is not entertaining  instead  it is painful to watch because of how terrible it is  the acting is unbelievably bad  in a dvd interview  one of the actors claimed that uwe boll  the director  is not afraid to tell someone when they are doing a good job or a bad job in a scene  this is a blatant lie  the script appears to have been written by an yearold  who decided to include a scene of someone throwing up on a girl's chest and to include the hilarious line  it smells like someone farted out here  the characters have no personality or depth and they do some of the most moronic things ever seen in a horror movie  somewhere along the way  the characters also magically transform into a swat team to take down the zombies  it's like they don't even have to aim their guns and they automatically shoot the zombies in the head the scariest thing by far about this movie is the directing  there is something wrong with uwe boll  boll's camera work is astonishingly disjointed  his pans to zombies running through the forest are more silly than menacing  worse yet  boll actually thought it would be a good idea to include small bits of footage from the house of the dead video game into the movie  quite often  and at the most random times  you will suddenly see an animated zombie getting shot  it makes no sense  no one in their right mind would think that was a good idea  it's like boll wants to remind us repeatedly that this movie is supposed to be based on the video game  uwe boll also decided it would be cool to include slow motion degree rotating shots during the action scenes  a la 'the matrix' unfortunately  he does it way too often and each shot is nauseating  the soundtrack to this movie also boggles the mind  most action scenes are accompanied by loud rap track  this also adds to the ensuing headaches caused by the atrocious 'house of the dead''house of the dead' isn't bad because it's based on a video game  in fact  it has very little to do with the video game  it also does not fit into the category of 'so bad that it's good' it does however fit into the category of 'so bad that it's painful' this movie just plain sucks  uwe boll should never be let anywhere near another movie set  even his presence will curse a production  to all the directors out there  whenever one of your movies gets a bad review  all you have to do is remember that you didn't make 'house of the dead' and you will feel much better  i will never get those minutes of my life back  to sum it up  words really cannot describe just how bad this movie is  everyone involved in the production of this film  especially uwe boll  should be ashamed of themselves  although what i have said may make 'house of the dead' sound funny  it really isn't  nothing about it is funny  avoid this at all costs

introducing two other plot lines that seemingly had little if anything to do with  well  much of anything  plot skeins involving the american trying to take over the vatican and the dark pope  while mildly interesting  did nothing to reveal to the viewer anything about the main characters  the attempts to tie these threads together were pathetic at best  secondly  please don't insult the intelligence of the viewer by inserting into the film scenes that are clearly obligatory  we had manufactured angst  manufactured love and most idiotically manufactured sex that seemed like a page right out of matrix reloaded with skullnumbing techno music  rather than developing character  these elements seemed like the cheap devices they clearly were  a halfhearted attempt at putting popcornchewing adolescents in the seats  thirdly  and most importantly  this movie seemed to ha ve an intriguing concept  we have scandal  we have religion and we have supernatural forces at play  why then do we learn almost nothing about anyone's background  we learn a little about alex  but even he gives up the passion of the priesthood to sleep with a woman after two days  a woman who tried to kill him during an exorcism at some point in the past  and alex is the most developed  if you can call it that  character in the entire film as the cliche goes nowadays  if you're going to see one movie this year  make sure it's not this one  there's about ten interesting minutes out of the intolerable minute affair  the only thing that saved me was going with a girl who i'm rather fond of out

1,i've read innumerable reviews talking about the superiority of the miniseries  i certainly can't agree on such a blanket statement  if you analyze all of the aspects of a video  film production  there are numerable areas where the film is arguably vastly superior certainly  many of the comments are valid with regard to particular areas of the miniseries  specifically regarding more threads customs officers and more developed threads such as the pakistani farmer and family  that said  i found catherine zetajones' character much more compelling as the desperate women  from poverty to riches who won't go back  that's a much more likable character than this cold women who didn't seem to have as much reason for her quick turn to evil  and yes  i understand  her children  she was desperate  i just didn't see her as being as desperate further  while i appreciated some of the more fleshed out story threads in the miniseries  benicio del toro's character was very compelling  an anchor for the film  that thread was changed as an alternative to the pakistani family in nothing but good ways  a fantastic adaptation  of course  i'm skeptical that someone so pure can exist within such a system  but i don't know enough about the politics of the nation to argue after watching the first episode of the miniseries  i actually rewatched the film  why  i kept reading about the fantastic acting  i found the performances in the first episode of the miniseries to be borderline laughable  certainly  this improved as the miniseries progressed  now having just finished both versions in a few days  i can't agree that the performances in the miniseries reached the same level as  say  benicio del toro  who was brilliant in the film  though ormand  paterson  shah  and lindsay duncan were very good  i also feel the police in the film far outclassed the miniseries  i was not impressed with the germans throughout finally  the dialogue  as delivered in the film  is much more nuanced  especially in the scenes which are almost verbatim  careful  you're beginning to sound like your husband  as opposed to hahahaha  you sound like karl  again  i found some of the acting in the mini series very unconvincing  this was a prime example other superior aspects of the film  in my opinion  score  cinematography  editing should i complain that the film wasn't longer  no  i think it was a fantastic adaptation given the format  the changes made stood on their own  i mean  would you sit in a theater for    hours  of course not miniseries  out of film  out of ,0,i've read innumerable reviews talking about the superiority of the miniseries i doubtless can't agree on such a blanket statement if you analyze all of the aspects of a video film production there are numerable areas where the film is doubtless vastly superior certainly many of the comments are valid with regard to especial areas of the miniseries specifically regarding more threading customs officers and more developed threads such as the pakistani farmer and family that said i found catherine zetajones' character much more so as the desperate women from poverty to riches who won't go back that's a much more likable character than this cold women who didn't transpires to have as mucho reason for her quick turn to evil and yes i understand her children she was desperate i just didn't consults her as being as despairing further while i appreciated some of the more fleshed out story threads in the miniseries benicio de toro's character was very compelling an anchor for the film that thread was changed as an alternative to the pakistani family in nothing but good ways a fantastic adaptation of course i'm skeptical that sounded so pure can exist within such a system but i don't soaps enough about the politics of the nation to argue after watching the first episode of the miniseries i actually rewatched the film why i kept reading about the fantastic acting i found the performances in the first episodes of the miniseries to be borderline laughable certainly this better as the miniseries progressed now having just finishing both versions in a few days i can't agree that the interpretations in the miniseries reached the same level as say benicio del toro who was brilliant in the book was ormand paterson shah and lindsay duncan were very good i also feel the policeman in the film far outclassed the miniseries i was not impressed with the germans across finally the dialogue as delivered in the film is much more nuanced especially in the scenes which are almost verbatim careful you're beginning to sound like your husband as opposed to hahahaha you sound like karl again i found some of the acting in the mini series very unconvincing this was a prime example other superior aspects of the film in my opinion score cinematographic editing should i complain that the film wasn't longer no i think it was a fantastic adaptation given the format the

0,i have just given a for thieves highway  i mention this for two reasons one to prove i'm not a git who only gives bad reviews but because the theme of the film has the same thread namely the falling in love with a woman of the night we all know pretty woman is a chick flick but you can't avoid them all  they'll eventually get you  pretty woman for me does two things  two terrible horrible ghastly things  firstly it portrays prostitution as a career more akin to that of a dancer  you know with absolutely great friends  leg warmers lots of giggling  borrowing each others make up  you see in the reality of pretty woman the prostitute and this is a street walker prostitute we're talking about here  has a great life  she's healthy happy with only the occasional whimper to explain her predicament  my feeling is this 'happy hooker' type protagonist is a lot more palatable than an even nearly realistic character  which for me begs the question if you make a movie about a type of person but are too chicken scared to adorn that player with the characteristics familiar to that role then why do it  if i make a film about a chef but don't want him to cook or talk about food or wear a white hat then why make a film about a chef in the first place  by bailing out and turning the hooker into a respectable dancer type the story misses the point completely and consequently never indulges in any of the moral or social questions that it could have  what a cop out  really really lame  secondly  'pretty woman' insults romance itself  edward lewis played by richard gere has no clue how to seduce or romance this 'lady' that is without his plastic friend  yep don't leave home without it  especially if you are a moron in a suit who has no imagination  out of of his romantic moments involve splashing cash in one way or another  even when he first meets her it's the lotus esprit turbo that does all the work  necklaces here diamonds there limos over there  money money money  where's the charm  where's the charisma  don't mention that attempt at the piano please girls who like this film will also be girls who like shopping more than most  guys who like this film will not even have realized that old eddy has less charm than a calculator  as they probably don't either so it wont have registered  more importantly anyone who likes this film will hate 'thieves highway' a wonderful story of which part is based on the same subject i'll finish on a songretty woman hangin round the street pretty woman  the kind i like to treat pretty woman  i don't believe you you're not the truth no one could spend as much as you mercypretty woman  wont you pardon me pretty woman  i couldn't help but see pretty woman  and you look lovely as can be do you lack imagination just like

talking about food or wear a white hat then why make a film about a chef in the first place by bailing out and turn the hooker into a respected dancing type the tale misses the point completely and consequently never indulges in any of the morales or social questions that it could have what a cop out genuinely really and secondly 'pretty boy humiliations romance itself edward lewis accomplished

0,i remember seeing the very first trailer for underdog back last march  i also remember at the time smiling to myself ever so slightly  sure it was a cheesy idea  but i genuinely thought at the time the concept might work  hell it couldn't be any worse than the disappointing cats and dogs could it  then by december and i suddenly remembered the film i realised how likely the film was to suck  the fact it had been delayed in the uk made it seem inevitable it would be terrible  but the horrendous reviews just made me realise it was nigh on impossible for the movie to be any good  still i swallowed my feelings and went to see the film with a friend today  as i entered my screen i was mortified  it was the very first time i'd be seeing a movie with a friend and being the only two in the screen  little did i know for what i was about to endure  underdog to put it blunt is horrendous  it really is  imagine how bad you could think this movie is and then prepare yourself for a movie even worse  that is just how pathetic the movie is  while it aims to entertain kids it just seems an embarrassing mess that seems to insult kids rather than allow them to enjoy the movie  matters cannot be helped by the fact that the story is beyond lacklustre  the acting is generally poor  and the movie just feels like an overlong  tired and downright boring saturday cartoon  after a brief five minutes where i thought the movie might be passable the movie just suddenly seems to die and then limp on towards the already sign posted finale  i'm just amazed the movie was actually ever released  it's an embarrassment to disney  hell half their straight to video sequels are better than this  what's even more terrifying is the fact the ending leaves room for a sequel so lets get onto the acting cracks knuckles  okay let me be honest jason lee is decent  his voice suits the canine  and had he have been given a decent script he might have made the performance work  however  with such a dodgy script he just seems to flounder  in many ways it reminded me of bill murray in garfield  murray did what he could with what he had  but what he had wasn't enough to make it passable  then we get onto the human actors  and well the majority of atrocious  alex neuberger plays the friend of underdog  jack  my biggest concern is that anybody would even take him seriously in an audition  the scene where he gets to fly with underdog is perhaps the most cringe worthy scene in the past few years just because his acting is so poor  not once did i believe he was a real person  in fact part of me is still convinced he was a robot made specially for the movie  james belushi seems half dead in the film  he has nothing to work with  no decent lines  he just seems to wander around the set waiting to become relevant to the plot  which the writers try to do towards the end but do it in such a poor way its laughable  thankfully peter dinklage is the one redeeming factor of the movie  he is great as dr barsinister and seems to be having a laugh in the role  he steals every scene he is in  although that's hardly difficult when he shares screen time with the extremely annoying patrick warburton  the rest of the cast are even worse  especially taylor momsen  she just needs to end her acting career right now underdog also fails dramatically in terms of delivering anything like a funny scene  when the funniest scene involves underdog biting a can and causing dog food to explode everywhere you know there is something drastically wrong  this could be easily ignored if the movie had decent action or a good story  alas the movie is even worse in both of these terms  the effects are so ropey that any scene where underdog flies just seems absurd  and the dog uses his powers to such little effect that you frequently forget he has superpowers  what's the point in making a film about a super dog if the damned dog never appears super  the final fight also verges on embarrassing purely because its ten minutes of nothingness  the dog flies  other stuff happens  some stuff gets chucked about  all of this is irrelevant as this stuff is happening for the sake of stuff happening  the script as well is dodgy at best and downright pain inducingly awful at worst  when someone says look its a plane  no its a bird  no its a frog   yes you read that right  i just wanted to burst into tears there and then  actually i wanted to walk out by remained compelled to see whether it could get any lower than that point  this happens near the end so it doesn't thankfully overall underdog becomes the worst movie of at this early period  and is actually just as bad as last years epic movie  luckily for underdog  meet the spartans arrives over here soon and i expect that to be even worse  so in case you didn't get the point of my review  avoid the film at all costs  if you want to see a movie with a dog then watch cats and dogs  buy a real dog if necessary  just do not see this ,0,i remember witnessing the very first trailer for underdog reverting last marci i also remember at the timeframe smiles to myself ever so slightly confident it was a dorky thought but i genuinely thought at the time the conceptions might work hellfire it couldn't be any roughest than the disappointing cats and dogs could it then by december and i unexpectedly reminded the time i realized how chance the film was to suckle the fact it had been delayed in the uk made it seem inevitable it should be appalling but the horrifying reviews just made me realise it was almost on unattainable for the movie to be any good still i consumed my feelings and went to behold the film with a friend today as i entered my pant i was mortified it was the very first times i'd be watching a movie with a friend and being the only two in the screen small did i know for what i was about to endure underdog to do it blunt is gruesome it really is imagine how bad you would think this movie is and then prepare yourself for a movie even worse that is just how pathetic the truth is while it aims to entertain kids it just seems an embarrassing mess that seems to insult infantile fairly than allow them to enjoy the film matters cannot be assistance by the fact that the stories is afterlife lacklustre the behaving is generally poor and the movies just deems adores an overlong tired and entirely boring sunday cartoon after a succinct five mins where i think the girl might be passable the movie just strikingly about to died and then flask on towards the already signature posted finale i'm just amazed the movie was indeed always released it's an awkwardness to disney whorehouse average their consecutive to video sequels are better than this what's so more terrifying is the fact the ending leaf room for a aftermath so lets get onto the behaving cracks knuckles okay letting me be candid jason reads is decent his voice suits the canine and had he have been given a decent script he possibly have made the performance work nevertheless with such a doubtful script he just seems to flounder in many methods it recall me of bill murray in garfield exmrs did what he did with what he had but what he had wasn't enough to make it passable then we get in the human actors and well the majority of atrocious alex neuberger plays the friend of underdog jack my biggest concern is that person did even taking

0,the fallen ones starts with archaeologist matt fletcher casper van dien in the desert discovering the mummified remains of a foot tall giant  now there's something you don't see everyday  matt is working for property developer morton robert wagner who wants to build a holiday resort on the land  he calls in fellow archaeologist angela kristen miller for reasons i'm unsure of  anyway they both try to figure out what they've got on they're hands when some of the team go missing  morton calls in security guy ammon navid negahban to handle the situation  meanwhile ancient text translator the rabbi eli schmidtt tom bosley translates some ancient text as he would  is shocked to learn of a evil prophecy in which these giants will rise up  take over the world for the fallen one  or something like that  it's up to matt to save the day  the whole planet  written  directed by kevin vanhook  who also has a small role in the film as the ancient warrior leader at the start  i personally thought the fallen ones was a terrible film  it's as simple  straight forward as that  there are so many things that are just plain bad about the fallen ones both on a technical  conceptual level  the script doesn't make a whole lot of sense  it doesn't really get going until the final odd minutes by which time i had almost lost the will to live  the character's are awful  as clichéd as you like  the dialogue is bad as in very  very bad  the entire film is predictable  i mean it's not going to come as a surprise that casper van dien is going to save the day is it  it's not a huge surprise that the mummified giant is going to come back to life either so why wait until over an hour into the film when most of the audience will be in some sort of comatose state  this is bad  very bad  you have been warned director vanhook doesn't impress  the fight scenes are absolutely awful  why dress your bad guys up in a horrible shade of purple  they look naff  to give it a bit of credit the special effects on the giant mummy itself are actually good although there's not that many of them since he doesn't make an appearance for over an hour  there are also some normal sized mummy's that look to have come straight from the set of the mummy   unfortunately these aren't used to any great effect  in fact are wasted as some comic relief  the mechanical mummy was a pretty good idea but looked silly  there is no way on earth that all those people inside could work in sync with each other to operate it  actually the more i think about the more ridiculous the idea is  forget about any scares  tension or atmosphere  don't even think about any gore or violence because there isn't any technically the fallen ones isn't anything special  apart from the impressive giant mummy effects there's little her to get excited about  the ghost cgi  water effects are terrible  it was madefortv  it's shows  the acting was poor  wagner looks embarrassed  this is probably the only thing the likes of dien  bosley can get these days the fallen ones is a bad film  there's no two ways about it as far as i'm concerned  not recommended on any level or in any way  one to avoid ,1,the fallen ones launching with archaeologist mattie fletcher everchanging van dien in the walkabout discovering the shrunken remains of a pedal tall gigantic now there's something you don't seeing everyday life is working for

the judaism ue schmidtt and bosley translates some old wording as he did is shock to learn of a devilish prophesy in which these tycoons will soar up take over the world for the fallen somebody or somethings fond that it's up to matt to savings the day the whole planet written focused by steph vanhook who furthermore has a minor role in the movies as the longtime warrior ringleader at the commence i personally thought the dipped ones was a terrible movies it's as simple straight forward as that there are so many matters that are just plain awry about the fallen ones both on a technological conceptually level the alphabet doesn't bring a totality lot of sense it doesn't truly attains disappearance until the final bizarre mins by which time i had almost outof the will to live the character's are awful as clichéd as you like the discussions is amiss as in very very amiss the together movie is predictability i mean it's not walkout to arriving as a surprise that caspar lorry dien is gonna to enjoy the jour is it it's not a prodigious surprise that the mummified jumbo is going to coming back to lives either so why wait until over an hour into the film when most of the audience will be in some sort of quadriplegic state this is awry very bad you have been warned headmaster vanhook doesn't tempt the fight image are altogether ghastly why dress your bad guys up in a horrible shade of purple they glance naff to giving it a bite of credit the special effects on the giant mamma itself are indeed alright although there's not that many of them after he doesn't bring an appearance for over an time there are also some normal calibre mummy's that look to have come straight from the set of the mom unfortunately these aren't utilised to any great effect in fact are

entertainment  is just lighter  gayer  purely and simply happier the numbers are more outrageous and less integral to the plot  and yet somehow it works better than all the dances and singing in anchors aweigh  i'm not quite sure why this is  the typical argument is that the latter film is overlong  at almost two and a half hours  this is certainly a valid criticism to make  i certainly felt the length the first two times i saw it  however  it's also a film that grows on youthe more you see it  the shorter it feels and the more you appreciate the technical mastery involved in its making  and yet  something just doesn't hang together quite right  it feels almost as if the script was pored over  and every single moment when kelly could break into dance or sinatra into song was noted  and that's exactly what happened  no opportunity to shoehorn a musical number in was given up  and that's probably the film's biggest weakness  it has numbers give or take a few  and no matter how big a fan you are of kelly or sinatra  this really starts to turn one numb after a while  contrast this  for example  with the ten numbers in on the town  you might well feel that each song  each dance  can't be taken out of the film without leaving it lacking  and that's true  but that's also because the writers weren't more restrained in adding them in in the first place all this long preamble doesn't mean there's nothing good about anchors aweigh  the musical is splashy with great songs bursting out all over  like the duets between kelly and sinatra 'we hate to leave' 'i begged her' and 'if you knew susie'  the singing of sinatra 'what makes the sunset' 'the charm of you' and the best of all  'i fall in love too easily'  and without a doubt the always inventive  always breathtaking dancing of kelly  it's also hard to miss with a cast of this calibre  grayson is sweet and seems to improve on each viewing her voice becoming stunning rather than frightening jose iturbi's role is written sympathetically and he does a great job with it  even clarence's own brooklyn  pamela britton  is cute and charming  as close as one could get to betty garrett without being garrett herself  sinatra is adorable with those blue eyes and curls of his  and plays the innocent boyman wonderfully a role he reprises in on the town  his singing is  as usual  simply faultless from enunciation through to timing and phrasing  his solo numbers might seem to drag a little  but when you've got the voice of a century  showcasing it is probably as good a reason as any to slow up the rest of the film gene kelly's sheer genius in this film is worthy of its own paragraph  third in the billing behind sinatra and grayson respectively  anchors aweigh really is kelly's film  his joe brady is a believable  real characterhe's tough on the outside  glib and willing to lie when necessary to win a gal  but he's actually the biggest softy on the inside  kelly makes this charming rather than cloying  but also gives joe a real edge that you see in the scene when joe chases brooklyn around the room with a genuinely murderous look on his face and his breakfast tray in his hands  and the dancingagain  the film suffers from the 'too much of a good thing spoils the effect' syndrome  as it does with sinatra's singing  but once again  if it's gene kelly doing the softshoe  or tapping across the screen in a sailor's outfit or dressed up as a bandit chief  might as well err on the side of overdoing it  all of kelly's dances are breathtaking  be it the pareddown simplicity of his tap number with sinatra to 'i begged her' his 'mexican hat dance' with the sweet wideeyed little girl  or his lavish spanishinfluenced dance 'la cumparsita' of course  the classic image left in audiences' minds for all time would be kelly in his red  white and blue sailor suit  dancing with jerry mouse of 'tom  jerry' fame  a welldeserved golden film memory  to be sureit's not often that one can say you're impressed by the special effects in a film made in given the saturation of cgi in the contemporary film market  but gene and jerry still look great  with kelly always hitting his spots and looking exactly where he needs to look  it would turn out that just about the only people who could really keep up with gene kelly would be kelly himself in cover girl and a cartoon animation  it's doubtless that this first daring  inventive kelly dance with jerry has reserved a place for anchors aweigh in film history and the hearts of classic film buffs  but it's also notable for being the

0, i normally hate puns  but this seems the only appropriate summary for barnyard i suspect i am not the first  and i'm sure many  many comments focus on the idiocy of bulls with udders  it certainly bothered me right off the bat  but there's much more wrong with this movie than a fundamental lack of knowledge about how mammals work personally  if i was a parent  i would be irritated by the violent turn it takes near the end in the showdown with the coyotes  although for me  it at least injected a little action  and from a conventional screen writing point of view  you might expect the coyotes to play a greater role in the conflictgee you have a widow cow  maybe her husband was killed by coyotes  nope  there's a much dumber explanation  and what kind of a farm is this  otis vows to protect all the animals from harm  but there certainly seems to be no threat from humans  they make reference to the farmer being vegan  but what is he raising pigs for  in all children's animal stories babe  charlotte's web  you name it  the reality of farm life is at least touched on  perhaps our friendly farmer is running some sort of rescue shelter there is some reference to this  but it's never explained  but all the farmer gets in return is abuse from a horse in a scene that is supposed to be funny  but left me seriously wondering if he was going to wind up buried in a shallow grave behind the barn  and what the heck is the deal with wild mike it was like the gimp scene in pulp fiction without the ballgag add in some truly awful attempts at emotional scenes  a nearly complete lack of laughs  and those udders  and you've got the worst kids movie i've seen in ages  i generally only post to imdb to highlight a film that's not so well known not to slam the current  boxoffice hit  but this movie angered me  it was taking up space in my local theater  space that could have been used to show something worthwhile  there's been plenty of good family entertainment this summer in fact there were at least more kids films playing at the same multiplex  but i'm not allowed to see something like little miss sunshine so viacom can cheat families out of an extra  at least i had a free pass i know that as a year old with no children  this film was not designed for me  but there's just no excuse for such a lazy  dreadful children's film as barnyard in the age of pixar  i was bored by the ice age films  but they certainly didn't anger me like barnyard shark tale was a weak attempt at street hipness  but it had quite a few laughs  for that matter  you could turn on nickelodeon at any time of the day  and see something more entertaining and intelligent which is why they should be ashamed for putting their name on this garbage i'm giving it a out of only because pip the mouse was sporadically amusing  and maria bamford had a few amusing lines as the farmers wife  well  not the farmer's wife  some other farmer  they didn't really explain who she was  they didn't explain a lot of things  especially not why sam elliot the ultimate man's man had an udder jiggling around down there  creepy ,1,i normally adore wordplay but this transpires the only befitting recap for barnyard i suspect i am not the firstly and i'm sure many many comments focus on the idiocy of bulls with udders it never bothered me coming off the wallop but there's much more erroneous with this movie than a fundamental shortage of acquaintance about how mammals work personally if i was a parent i would be followed by the vehement turning it takes nearer the end in the showdown with the leafs whilst for me it at least injecting a petite more and from a traditional screen writing point of visualizing you might expect the coyotes to gaming a greater rolle in the conflictgee you have a widows bitchy possibly her husband was killed by coyotes not there's a much dumber explanation and what kind of a farm is this clarence pledge to protection all the animals from harm but there certainly seems to be no menaces from humans they make reference to the farmer being vegan but what is he increased pigs for in all children's wildlife stories bebe charlotte's web you behalf it the reality of farms lives is at least impacted on potentially our friendly farmer is running some sort of rescue sanctuary there is some reference to this but it's never explained but all the rancher gets in return is abuse from a panorama in a scene that is presumption to be droll but left me deeply wondering if he was going to blustery up burial in a simplistic grave behind the barn and what the heck is the deal with wild mike it was fond the gimp scene in pulp newness unless the ballgag added in some truly ghastly tries at sentimental scene a nearly complete dearth of laughs and those milking and you've got the worst kids movie i've seen in age i generally only position to imdb to highlight a filmmaking that's not so bah proverbial not to slam the contemporary boxoffice hit

1,anthony minghela's writer  director cold mountain is a carefully constructed  sensitive  and intelligent drama set in the social context of the confederacy during the civil war  which deals with the politics of the war in a very subtle and realistic manner  while it accurately depicts the brutality and inhumanity of that war  it also does something that many films related to this period to not handle as effectively  cold mountain studies the southern context from the inside out  and portrays changes among the nonslave owning common people wrought by the war  and  almost uniquely  cold mountain does not overgeneralize southerners  northerners or anybody else the film surfs through genres as needed  never presenting a dull moment  it is a romance  a war story  an actionadventure and historical fiction  all nicely woven into one the story centers on inman jude law and ada monroe nicole kidman  who are smitten with each other for very simple reasons  as this young romance begins to bud  inman enlists in the confederate army  taking with him a book ada has given him and a photograph of her  ada's character is one of the most brilliant aspects of the film  which is important because the audience experiences this film from a third person perspective  but the story is clearly hers from the beginning to the end  ada is an intelligent southern belle and daughter of a liberal minister  she begins the film as a daddy's girl skilled in many of the arts that southern women who have been surrounded by servants most of their lives were expected to learn  in other words  as she admits to ruby thewes renee zellweger  she is a master of everything useless ada's father passes on  and she is left to manage his modest estate by herself  with no experience of this sort  she struggles  and survives by holding the memory of inman close to her heart  ruby enters the picture as a tough young woman who has been raised by a drunk and negligent father  ruby has all the skills and abilities ada lacks  and as they become inseparable business partners  they grow to love one another as best friends  inman's experience is radically different  but something of a mirror image  during his participation in the war  he sees many friends killed for causes they don't really believe in  and decides to desert  nobody he meets comes to his rescue as he begins the thousand mile walk back to cold mountain and ada  and most of those he meets die the bulk of the film takes place during inman's long walk  following both of the protagonists as they live  learn  grow and change  an ongoing act of will borne of desperation preserves their intense passionate love  for inman  it is his only source of hope in a world of pure desperation  for ada  it is very much the same thing  but also a symbol and remnant of the old south  a world which is rapidly passing the cinematography is powerful and breathtaking  there are beautiful shots of appalachian landscapes which give the film a strong sense of history  the script and editing are also extremely strong  emphasizing the broad class and educational differences reflected in the ante bellum southern dialects of the middle and lower classes  with the cast of this film  nothing short of perfection should be expected  and the cast  mostly  rises to the occasion  my one criticism  however  relates to the accents adopted by kidman and law's characters  an australian and a brit probably should not be expected to accurately reproduce southern american speech  but there are a few occasions where these two exceptionally gifted actors produce distracting vocal slips  i admit my oversensitivity to this  and can say with some confidence that it won't bother most people  zellweger's performance is outstanding and she creates a character i will remember into my senescence very highly recommended ,0,anthony minghela's writer director of mountain is a carefully constructed sensitive and intelligent drama set in the

0,i'm not going to say that this movie is horrible  because i have seen worse  but it's not even halfway decent  the plot is very confusing  i couldn't really figure out what was happening and where things were going  when the movie was over  i was left scratching my head  i watched through to the end of the credits to see if they had something after them that may clear things up  but once the credits were over  that was it  i felt like i was jarred from one weak plot point to another throughout the whole movie  with little or no transition between the two  character development is very shallow  i couldn't figure out when somebody was angry or had a grudge against someone  i couldn't tell if half of the characters were just supposed to be drunk  stoned  mentally challenged or they just had a bad actor to portray them  this film seems to be based around stereotypes to it's credit  they are hard to avoid using when you are making a film about a singer in a rock band  which should make character development easier  since so many other films have already illustrated the suffering of an abused child  or the trials of a heroin addict trying to come clean  stereotypes are easy to depict  which would explain why so many bad films tend to overuse stereotypical characters  this film  on the other hand  uses stereotypical characters left and right  but then tries to keep them as incomprehensible as possible another problem with the characters is that they seemed to be dismissed with no explanation  i guess that's ok because so little time was spent developing the characters that i really didn't get a chance to know any of them  so i never really missed any of them and last but not least was sadie's singing  it's awful  the music backing her up is not prize winner  but it is usually drowned out by the screeches that are released from sadie's vocal cords  i swear that there's one point in the movie where she sings a song for at least minutes  i seriously thought i was going to have to turn it off during this howlathon as a whole  this movie is confusing  characters are illdeveloped  georgia's acting is wooden and stiff  sadie's character is yanked from one bad situation to another  with no back story or explanation  the music was unbearable  and i can think of no good reasons to see this film unless you have a thirst for cinematic pain ,1,i'm not vanishing to said that this movie is horrific because i have seen lousiest but it's not even mid decent the conspiracies is very puzzling i couldn't really figure out what was transpired and where facets were going when the filmmaking was over i was left scratching my head i watched through to the ends of the credits to see if they had somethings after them that maybe unequivocal facets up but once the credit were over that was it i felt adore i was evilness from someone weak conspiracies matter to others throughout the whole film with little or no passage between the two character evolving is very facile i couldn't graphic out when somebody was angry or had a grudge against someone i couldn't tell if half of the nature were just presumption to be drunkard stoned or challenged or they just had a sleazebag ballplayer to portray them this movie occurs to be based around prejudices to it's credit they are hard to stave use when you are becoming a film about a singer in a rocky band which should deliver personage evolution easier since so many other movies have already illustrated the distress of an mistreatment kid or the trials of a hero addict striving to come clean misconceptions are simple to illustrate which would explain why so many amiss films tend to overuse stereotypes personages this movie on the other hands utilizing stereotypical nature leave and rights but then tries to keep them as impenetrable as attainable another hassles with the nature is that they watched to be dismissed with no justification i guess that's ok because so little timeframe was spent devising the personages that i really didn't obtain a chances to soaps any of them so i never really flunked any of them and past but not least was sadie's sung it's horrible the concerto help her up is not award winner but it is habitually sank out by the howls that are emitted from sadie's vocal wire i cuss that there's eden point in the movie where she sings a song for at fewer minutes i seriously thought i was going to have to transforming it off during this howlathon as a totality this movie is baffling nature are illdeveloped georgia's acting is lumbering and stiff sadie's character is yanked from one bad situation to another with no back tale or explanation the music was unbearable and i can think of no nice reasons to refer this film till you have a craving for cinematic pain,0.5217019319534302,98,0.8252365930599369,N,0.23,0.001762076048180461

1,minor spoilers followsteve allen opined that topical humor about serious events might be found by many to be acceptable based on the formula  tragedytimecomedy  before the german assault on poland was hardly a fun period and subsequent events  including the blitzkrieg following the sitzkrieg which took germany to the channel  resulted in the heroic evacuation at dunkirk and gave the world the sickening spectacle of a supine france prostrating its honor before the nazi conqueror the stuff of romance  comedy and a big dollop of serious drama  yep  director jeanpaul rappeneau  with a wellmatched and outstanding cast  creates in bon voyage a pastiche of events and scenes from history and from imagination that is hugely entertaining viviane denvers the sloeeyed and beautiful isabelle adjani is france's top actress as war clouds gather over europe what an overused cliche  sorry  a veteran selfvenerating bedhopper with many affairs to her credit  her inner motivation seems to be whatever is good for viviane is good for  viviane  following a premiere of her latest film after which a minister in the incompetent reynaud administration  jeanetienne beaufort gerard depardieu in an unusual role for him  signals his interest in her  she goes home only to tiredly encounter an exlover who doesn't understand the word no  she decisively resolves that issue but then frantically and histrionically enlists another former beau  the still besotted frederic gregory derangere  to help deal with the mess in her flat  frederic is a novelistinexpectation a comic accident that once again highlights  almost as a public service message  the importance of working windshield wipers puts frederic in jail on most serious charges  fortunately the breakout of the germans from their static positions forces a wholesale transfer of prisoners to the south of france but our boy escapes  making his way there privately rather than as a ward of the state the panic and fear in france as the germans swept to victory is well portrayed and a new twist enters the story  who should frederic encounter but the truly gorgeous young research assistant  camille virginie ledoyen who is accompanying the obligatory jewish refugee scientist  professor kopolski jeanmarc stehle  kopolski has some bottles of heavy water he needs to get to england  of course the germans musn't latch on to this vital ingredient for you know what this part is pure fictionthere was never any heavy water in france in just perrier  and camille is so winsome as well as dedicated what next  peter coyote as a supposed french journalist  alex winckler  be tipped off as to his name  he's really an officer in the abwehr german military intelligence  a spy  and he used to bed viviane too and wants a reprise of their affair  apparently the kind kopolski is the only major male character who doesn't want to have it off with the actress what follows is a series of adventures and mishaps that are seamlessly

1,hey  this ralf westhoff seems to knows a lot about people  we have nine women and nine men taking part in a speed dating event  each person has five minutes to talk to each opposite  a good idea to make a movie out of these conversations  and even better  it works very  very well  the dialog is witty  original and authentic  each person is subtly characterized  without falling into the cliché trap  something that is unusual for german movies  remember  all these years  we germans were tormented with silly zeitgeist comedies such as workaholic or stadtgesprächbut now the time has come for young german directors to do their own thing and take the risk of producing movies which are entertaining and funny and intelligent and sensitive at the same time  the timing of shoppen is good  too  although it presents mainly dialog  it keeps the tension and interest  after a while  you actually become curious to see how this man and that woman would do  some of the participants meet later on for a twosome  it's fun to see them interacting together in real life of course  the film has a few drawbacks  it's not very cinematic but can such a movie be   the musical soundtrack could have been better  but all this is only marginal the most important thing about this movie  we have some damn good actors here  imagine this  all of them are still pretty unknown even here in germany most were derived from the munich or bavarian theater scene  but i predict that out of the main actors  at least will quickly become very wellknown in the movie and tv scene over here  it's great to see so many fresh and at the same time talented faces  welldone for those who want to read more  here's a rundown of all actorsspoilers sebastian weber  silent waters are deep  memorize his flower garden monologue  you can win any woman's heart with this one anna böger  a hell of a woman  every time she opens her mouth  you can't help but laugh and feel good  listen how she pronounces asshole and calls the pink shirt guy a bürscherlfelix hellmann  the bürscherl from above is fun to watch  the inconvenient truth is that there are too many of those guys around  his looks somewhat reminded me of flo weber of sportfreunde stillerkatharina schubert  this woman has everything  love  hope  despair  beauty  her do you want children scene is a classic  a great actress of whom we will hear again  no doubt david baalcke  now is this guy a loser or not  almost as authentic as paul giamatti in sideways i hope this is not method acting julia koschitz  the good looking woman in the circle  julia used to play theater in my hometown  kudos  i think she will appear in many tv series to come martin butzke  the revolutionary guy catches the cutest and most conventional woman in the end  would you like to share a taxi with this guy kathrin von steinburg  she gave a stunning performance in tatort last year  her trancelike performance in this movie is no less  see her beautiful face and hear her dirty

taking part in a speed dating event each persons has five mins to talk to each opposite a terrible idea to make a movie out of these conversations and even better it works very very well the dialog is erudite original and authentic each person is finely characterized without falling into the cliché entrapment something that is unusual for german movies remember all these years we germans were tormented with silly zeitgeist comedies such as workaholic or stadtgesprächbut now the time has come for young german directors to do their own thing and take the risk of producing movies which are amuse and funny and intelligent and sensitive at the same time the timing of shoppen is alright too although it presents mainly dialog it keeps the tension and interest after a while you actually become curious to see how this man and that woman would do some of the participants meet later on for a twosome it's fun to see them imparting together in real life of course the film has a few drawbacks it's not very cinematic but can such a movie be the musical soundtrack could have been better but all this is only marginal the most important thing about this conversation we have some goddam good actors here imagine this all of them are still pretty unknown even here in germany most were derived from the munich or bavarian forest scene but i predict that out of the main actors at least will quickly become very wellknown in the movie and tv scene over here it's grand to see so many cost and at the same time talented faces welldone for those who want to read more here's a rundown of all actorsspoilers sebastian weber silent waters are deep memorize his flower garden monologue you can win any woman's essence with this one anna böger a hell of a woman every time she opens her mouth you can't help but laugh and feel good listens how she pronounces asshole and calls the pink shirt guy a bürscherlfelix hellmann the bürscherl from above is droll to watch the inconvenient truth is that there are too many of those guys around his looks somewhat reminded me of flo weber of sportfreunde stillerkatharina schubert this woman has everything love hope despair beauty her do you want children scene is a classic a great actress of whom we will hear again no doubt everchanging baalcke now is this guy a loser or not nigh as authentic as paul giamatti in

0,well  i can honestly say that this is the first time that i experienced a film that had literally no meat or potatoes in it  the entire film felt like it was just the salad with no main course  the story line was fallible and laughable  the characters were onedimensional  the realism was out the window  and the animation was done by fouryear olds  does that cover it  i have never been more embarrassed for a concept in my entire life  i have never read the comics or seen the other programs with this character  but from the looks of the other reviews i am not off base with my observation to begin  the story moved too quickly  for someone new to this character and situations  i needed more built into creating the reasons instead of finding the solution  i have seen other anime if you could call this one an anime that do great things with their characters because they take the time to develop them  there was nothing set aside for lady death  in a few short scenes  we see her train with cremator and instantly become this aggressive shebeast of hell  this was hard for me to swallow  considering moments before she was introduced as this weak and feeble woman controlled by her father  suddenly  she is immersed with hatred and can do battle with an existence that has been around for millions of years  this was absurd  the presentation of lady death was poor  to say the least  i felt as if she was nothing more than an animated character instead of a desperate woman with revenge on the mind  for me  it just didn't work  she was nothing more than eyecandy for prepubescent boys wanting to ogle the mass quantities of skin that she suddenly grew on her chest when training with cremator  oh  i felt sick just watching her  the same goes for the character of cremator  who was this random person  the explanation they gave wasn't enough  and instead i was left with more incoherent babbling than actual development  it is a very sad day in hell when we forgo characters to show more violence and action  especially in an animated feature next  there was lucifer himself  let me just say that i think i could do battle with the king of hell and survive  he was weak  his voice was laughable  and he just didn't represent the image that i had in my mind  it was as if disney was in control and wanted to make him semipc  he lacked the darkness and corrupt nature that lucifer embodies  he was not the ruler of hell  but instead just a lackey that had a bigger place to live  speaking of living or dying  how can you die again in hell  that was a concept that definitely needed more explanation  most of the characters were worrying about dying  when they didn't even consider the option that they were already dead  that is how they got to hell  i think it was this level of thinking that ruined the film for me  i didn't quite capture the notion that your soul was still in a solid body in hell  but that could just be me or maybe it was because there was no development in this story  there was nothing built  just preparing the battle sequences were hysterically bad  the animation in this cartoon felt like it was made in the early s  there was nothing impressive about the way that this film was drawn  why are we  america  so behind on animation  it is huge in asia  and it is creeping in hardcore here because we keep making films like lady death that do not challenge or use any part of imagination  we are cheap  and this film shows it overall  this film was bad  the animation coupled with the horrendous voice work was cheap  i had head somewhere that this film as in production for a long time  which is hard to understand because i think i could have made this film on my credit card  the production was horrendous as well as the story  nothing was developed  leaving huge gaping plot holes that nearly everyone fell into  the strength of the characters was missing  and nothing was explained  i wasted my time with this one and would like to warn others so that when death does come  you don't find yourself in my state and regretting the fact that you wasted minutes on this piece of garbage blah  grade   out of ,1,well i can

characters not including the security guard and  to be honest  only three or four were really used  two characters the token black guy and some other girl that wasn't important enough to get a label barely spoke  between them  i'd estimate about five or six lines total  also  the girls other than one weren't formed well enough to differentiate them from one another  they could've replaced each of the girls with one another repeatedly throughout the film and i wouldn't have noticed the difference  the pacing  however  works well as the horror begins right from the start and rarely ceases  the

1,there are two distinct ways to enjoy this snappily written  seminal tv show the godfather to xfiles and buffy  etc  as a monster show it scared the hell out of me when i was a kid   or as a wellwritten  acted gumshoe  filmnoir  it works on both levels  the scariness may have been diluted over the years it was made in the mids  but i was pleasantly surprised upon rediscovering the show via dvd that i actually enjoy it more now for the latter reasons  the late darren mcgavin is karl kolchak  an eccentric  tenacious  rumpled newsman  monsterhunter who  in pursuit of a story  always finds a supernatural angle  much to the pain of kolchak's overstressed  putupon boss tony vincenzoplayed with tremendous worldweariness by the also late  great simon oaklan you can practically feel the pain of his budding ulcers   the interplay between these characters is crackling and witty much like star trek's spock and mccoy  only more acidic   over the course of two pilot tv movies and a oneseason series  kolchack fought vampires  robots  werewolves  witches  zombies  government conspiracies  aliens  and ancient legends sounds like the entire yr  run of the xfiles  in one season   and

over the years it was made in the mids but i was pleasantly surprised after rediscovering the shows via dvd that i actually enjoy it more now for the latter reasons the late darren mcgavin is karl kolchak an eccentric tenacious mussed newsman monsterhunter who in pursuit of a story always finds a supernatural angle much to the pain of kolchak's overstressed putupon boss tony vincenzoplayed with tremendous worldweariness by the also late great simon oaklan you can only feeling the weighing of his budding ulcers the interaction between these character is crackling and sardonic much like star trek's spock and mccoy only more acidic over the course of two pilot telly movies and a oneseason serial kolchack fought bloodsuckers robots werewolves witches zombies government conspiracies aliens and ancient tales sounds like the entire olds run of the xfiles in one season and kolchak did it first and as for composing gil melle's cooling partlywhistled main title music okey xfiles creator

0,i don't know what i missed here  but i can't believe all these positive comments by so many people on this film  i thought it was silly  and a bit over the top  i did like the performances of gregg henry and michael rooker  however the others were just  boring now i like b movies  i really do  but this was a bit further down the alphabet for me  i saw someone compare the humor and horror in this to army of darkness and shaun of the dead as well as on par with the reanimator you must be joking  i didn't find this film funny  it tried  it did make an effort  possibly too much of an effort  but it failed in my opinion  by the time i was hit with the rd or th oneliner i was rolling my eyes and checking my watch there were definitely homages made to several other films  which is always cool  kind of like an inside joke for us horror fans  but here it may have just been a lack of original thought  admittedly there were some nice special effects  good gore  but that can't carry an entire movie  the mutated grant looked like a cross between jabba the hut  and in the early stages of mutation chet from weird science after he was turned into the monster and one of the alien creature  children from the explorers it just didn't work  i thought it looked like something some kid from grade art class could have designed  then there was brenda  the woman that grant impregnated and chained up in the barn  when help finally arrived she looked like a giant tick waiting to be popped  the design once again was totally unimaginative  a round flesh colored balloon with a face in the middle  yawn now about the zombies the more movies i see with zombies in them these days the more i wish george a  romero had a patent on them and was the only writer  director allowed to make movies about them  he's the only person so far to do it right  with the exception of edgar wright and simon pegg but that was a comedy  oh  and danny boyle  but they were a different style of zombie  maybe mr  romero has ruined any zombie film for me due to his ingenious ability to get his actors to moan  groan and shamble about as if their joints are dried up and lacking even a drop of synovial fluid  and their muscles are fighting the effects caused by rigor mortis that had started to set in right before they were reanimated  the people of wheelsy just didn't have the proper motivation  they were horrible zombies so in the end i give slither a for a couple of laughs and a few nice gore scenes ,1,i don't know what i missed here but i can't believe all these positives comment by so numerous

0,ok so this is about minutes of gore with no story whatsoever  there is no spoken dialogue  no subtitles  not even any real characters  you see three people in the entire movie that are alive and two are just there for very little reason  the main guy has no emotion and just mutilates corpses for no apparent reason  that is the entire movie  i love to see very gory movies  especially since in america real gore just isn't very common in modern movies  so yeah the gore effects were pretty cool  but it just isn't really disturbing  why does everyone think it's so disturbing  there are no characters at all  there are just living people and corpses  no one has any personality or back story  you see three corpses being hacked apart and you can't really identify with it unless you just identify with death itself and how this could very well happen despite the guy losing his job and going to jail very shortly after  to be disturbing the viewer has to care and to care they have to identify with the victim  for example in a good horror movie you should really care about the main character  here it's just a guy and a corpse  it's as deep as a puddle made from only a single rain drop  they never give you any reason to care about anyone in the movie  all it is a guy hacking up a few bodies  then he has sex with a body  now with the sex scene here is an odd thing about it  he makes sure to wear gloves but doesn't use a condom  so he couldn't care less about catching some weird std from having sex with a corpse but as long as his hands don't get messy there is no problem  now that is really logical  i don't really dislike the movie  i liked that it was very gory but when it ends there is no reason to watch it again  no reason to even care  and it just isn't a very compelling movie  i say if you can find it for under dollars then you might as well get it but if it's more than that it just isn't worth it ,1,ok so this is about minutes of gore with no stories whatsoever there is no spoken dialogue no subtitles not even any veritable characters you see tres people in the entire film that are vibrant and deux are just there for very little reason the main fella has no emotion and just mutilates corpses for no apparent reason that is the sweetest movie i adores to see very gory film especially since in america real gore just isn't very shared in modern movie so yeah the valli effects were belle coolio but it just isn't really disquieting why does everyone thought it's so disturbing there are no nature at all there are just living people and cadavers no one has any personality or back story you see three corpses being hacked apart and you can't really identify with it unless you just identify with fatalities itself and how this works very well arrives despite the fella losing his job and going to jail very quickly after to be disquieting the beholder has to empathy and to care they have to identify with the victim for example in a good horror movie you should really care about the main character here it's just a guy and a corpse it's as profound as a puddles made from only a single rain drop they never give you any reason to empathetic about anybody in the movie all it is a guy hacking up a few bodies then he has nationality with a body now with the sexuality scene here is an odd thing about it he makes sure to wear gloves but doesn't use a condom so he couldn't care less about catching some weird std from having sex with a corpse but as long as his hands don't obtains messy there is no problem now that is really logical i don't genuinely dislike the movie i liked that it was very gory but when it end there is no reason to watch it again no motif to even care and it just isn't a very compelling movie i say if you can found it for under dollars then you might as well get it but if it's more than that it just isn't worth it,0.5226507186889648,38,0.9190587018360488,Y,0.1,0.03445616737008095

1,i agree with the previous comment in naming the film's content everyday madness but would like to specify that  dog days is about how women are treated in a male society  the episodes we get to see here show some variation in everyday discrimination of women  mostly categorized by age group  there is a senior man who makes his new partner look and act the way his late wife had  treating her like a doll that shall act worthy of wearing the former's dress  there is a middleaged couple in whose relationship she is nearly a slave and he a  violent  master  further we find a somewhat younger man who does not communicate with his friend  wife and instead of being really jealous about her affairs even makes friendship with his competitor s   a young adult man makes clear to his friend  a girl who is really troubled by being pretty enough for him  that she has to be the jewelry at his side and to follow his narrow viewed rules of etiquette  finally there is a man in his late fifties who calculating his own advantage delivers a simpleminded hitchhiking woman to a furious client who  taking her for guilty in having scratched his car  natural beats her up  to complete the examples we find the pal of the man in the masterslavecouple  after collectively abusing her  threatening and humiliating the former in her sake for she shall get rid of her partner and take himself as her new master during all this the inhabitants of the lately built neighborhood in which the action takes place rests under the burning summersun  absolutely motionless sic   unfortunately i have not seen the last minutes of this shocking and authentic portray of the archaic structures that still reign in the relationship between women and men  but what i have seen convincingly analyzed the repertoire of discrimination  probably a helpful tool in teaching even the less sensitive spectator what goes wrong  due to good visualization ,0,i agree with the previous comment in naming the film's content everyday madness but did like to specify that terrier days is about how women are treated in a male society the episodes we get to see here show some variation in everyday discrimination of women mostly categorized by age group there is a senior man who makes his new casual look and act the way his late woman had treating her like a doll that shall act worthy of wearing the former's dress there is a middleaged couple in whose relationships she is nearly a slave and he a violent master further we find a somewhat younger man who does not communicate with his friend wife and instead of being really jealous about her affairs even makes friendship with his competitor s a young adult man makes clear to his friend a girl who is really troubled by being pretty enough for him that she has to be the jewelry at his side and to follow his narrow viewed rules of etiquette finally there is a man in his late fifties who calculating his own advantage delivers a simpleminded hitchhiking woman to a furious consumers who taking her for guilty in having scratched his car natural beats her up to complete the examples we find the secret of the man in the masterslavecouple after collectively abusing her threatening and humiliating the former in her sake for she shall get rid of her partner and take himself as her new master during all this the dwellers of the lately built neighbourhood in which the action takes place rests under the burning summersun absolutely motionless sic unfortunately i have not seen the last mins of this alarming and veritable portray of the archaic structures that still was in the relationship between women and mens but what i have seen convincingly analyzed the repertoire of discrimination probably a helpful tool in teaching even the less sensitive spectator what goes wrong due to good visualization,0.42777469754219055,14,0.9643418982695332,Y,0.04,0.7615659832954407
1,i had lost faith in sooraj r  barjatya after the movie main prem ki deewani hoon  then a year back now i saw promos for vivah which looked good  but i didn't want to waste my hard earned money watching it in cinema  when the film first came out on dvd i rented it and watched and i loved the movie and took back my words for sooraj  i just finished watching it yesterday again and this time i thought i have to review this movie  sooraj r  barjatyagot it right this time  okay i was not a huge fan of hum app ke hai kaun  but i have always loved manie pyar kiya  after manie pyar kiya to me i think vivah is barjatyas best work  i hardly ever cry in a movie but this movie made me feel like crying  if you have ever been in love before then there will be many moments that will touch you in this movie  the movie is just too sweet and will have you falling in love with it  my view a much underrated movie the story of this movie you might call desi and very old times  but to me it seemed modern because the two couples which are getting an arrange marriage are aware it's an old tradition  it's done in present times  lots of people don't believe in this arrange marriage  but i do  the journey between the engagement and wedding which will always be special and this movie shows it clearly  when prem meets poonam for the first time  they show it how it is and that's reality and my parents where saying that's how they got married and it showed it in a way which is so real yes people the way prem and poonam meet in this movie is how most marriages happen  it was a very sweet  you feel nervous yet excited  the song do ajnabe shows that very well  getting back to the story yes it's a journey which you soon get glued to between prem and poonam shahid kapoor and amrita rao and there families  a twist occurs in this movie which is really good  the last mins you all will be reaching for the tissue box what makes this film so amazing is the chemistry between prem and poonam  how they fall for each other is too sweet  simple boy and simple girl  when they first meet during and after the song do anjane ajnabe it's very sweet to watch  she hardly says anything and prem does all the talking being honest with her about his past and the girl he liked and him smoking  then it leads on to them all having a family trip and then that's when they really do fall for each other  it makes you just want to watch the couple and watch all the sweet moments they have  another factor is that poonam chichi is really mean to her and you feel sorry for poonam because she has been treated bad and makes you want to see her happy and when she finally finds happiness  you too start feeling happy with her the movie basically makes you fall in love with poonam more then just prem  when she finds happiness through prem you want her to stay happy and also hope nothing goes wrong because the character is shown as a sweet simple girl  which brings me to performances and amrita roa as poonam is amazing in the movie  her best work till date you will fall in love with this innocent character and root her on to find happiness  shahid kapoor as prem is amazing too  he is poonam support in the film  he is her happiness the movie  together they share an amazing chemistry and i have never seen a cuter couple since srk and kajol  if ishq vishk didn't touch you to telling you how cute they are together this surely will  mujhe haq hai the song and before that is amazing chemistry they show  scenes which touched me was when prem takes poonam to his room and shows her that's where they will be staying and he opens her up and they have a moment between them which is too sweet  again if you have ever been in love with someone that much these scenes you can defiantly connect to  the film is just the sweetest thing you will see ever the direction is spot on  to me a good movie is basically something that can pull me in and stop me believe for this hours what is being seen here is fake and there is a camera filing them  to me this film pulled me in and for those three hours i felt really connected to the movie  the songs you will only truly like when you have seen the movie as they are songs placed in the situation after i saw the movie i been playing the songs non stop  the music is amazing  the story is simply amazing too what more can i ask for what i can finally say it  rarely do we get a movie that makes us feel good  this movie after you have seen it will make you feel really good and make you want to be a better person  its basically the sweetest journey ever  its basically showing you they journey between engagement and marriage and many people say it's the bestest part of your life well this movie actually shows you way do people actually say that  why do people actually say that the journey is just that amazing  watch this movie and you will find out why the journey is amazing ,0,i had lost faith in sooraj r barjatya after the movie

1,i watched asterix and obelix in operation cleopatra  which was my first exposure to the live action version of the classic comic  like the comic the whole movie is full of jokes based upon puns  anachronistic jokes and slapstick gags which rarely fall flat asterix and obelix are gauls who use a strength potion to fight the roman legions in their native gaul  here they end up in egypt helping a friend build cesar's palace yes its puny in three months to prove the egyptians are just as good as the romans the reason i picked this up was because monica belluci is cleopatra  she's good but the role is little more than a cameo  however  even though she's rarely in the film i didn't care since its so clever and the jokes so funny i was in hysterics  i loved it  i loved it so much that i can't understand why the movies have never been released in the united states the import dvd has the film in english dub which is quite good especially when you consider that when you watch it in the longer french version the puns and hence the jokes are not always apparent since they are aural  so if you read the names wrong the jokes are lost  most of the jokes between the full french version and the shorter english dub seem to be exactly the same  though some have been changed sometimes for the better and some times for the worse  personally i'm gonna stick with the dub when i watch this again since its easier to pick up the jokes and enjoy the humor you really will want to see this if you love puns and low brow  but clever humor this is a great comedy,0,i watched evilness and exmrs in operation aphrodite which was my first explanatory to the live action printing of the conventional comic like the funny the whole film is full of jokes predicated once puns anachronistic jokes and slapstick escapades which sparsely fall platter tintin and obelix are gauls who use a strength potion to combating the roman legions in their native boner here they ceases up in egypt helping a pals build cesar's palate yea its puny in ch week to proven the egyptians are just as bad as the romans the reason i picked this up was because angelika belluci is poseidon she's good but the role is little more than a cameo nevertheless even although she's hardly in the film i didn't care because its so brainy and the jokes so funny i was in hysterics i loved it i loved it so mucho that i can't comprehend why the movies have never been releasing in the united states the import mov has the film in englishmen dub which is belle good especially when you investigated that when you watch it in the longer french prints the quip and hence the quips are not perpetually overt oj they are audible so if you lise the names wrong the jokes are lost most of the jokes between the fullest french version and the original britons armin seem to be exactly the same though some have been changed intermittently for the better and some period for the worse myself i'm gonna stick with the funk when i observational this again because its easier to pick up the jokes and enjoy the comedy you frankly will wanting to behold this if you love puns and meager brow but no humor this is a great comedy,0.4372561872005463,62,0.8445988629185092,N,0.21,0.982030987739563
