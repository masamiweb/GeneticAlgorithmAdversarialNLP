0,first of all  this film is glacially slowmoving  and i can see most viewers losing patience with it altogether in the first thirty minutes the film's subject matter was one i think would form the basis of an excellent film  what was most lacking here was a plot that would advance the underlying themes it's unfortunate  because in the hands of a writer like  say  lanford wilson  i think symbolism like a mountainlion invading a school campus could take on great  tragic proportions without being heavyhanded i think  with a good script supporting the film  the same filmmaker  with the same tastes  and even with the same actors who didn't really even get a chance to impress me  might have been able to present a meaningful and touching depiction of the pains and struggles that a boy goes through when he develops a powerful crush on an older boy that he admires however  i'm sorry to say that without this foundation  and armed with a vague  dullwitted  and vastly uninteresting script  without any sort of plot in sight  and lacking any sort of sensible structure for example  after viewing it  i believe you will find that you cannot point to climactic scenes  and instead  will find yourself enumerating well  maybe that scene  or that one  were climaxes  the result is minutes of tedium without a good plot  we never get terribly interested in any of the characters  their trials and difficulties are simply dull and boring without a good plot  dramatic devices and surrealistic directorial liberties become puzzling and confusing rather than enhancements to the storyline  i never really could believe  for example  the creation of leah and i think that most viewers would be utterly baffled by the conventional way in which her telephone calls were filmed as the film stands  i'm afraid it's one i cannot recommend at all  what i can never understand is why a film like this one isn't remade by an enterprising filmmaker  instead of all the mediocre remakes of films that were superlatively good in the first release  all it needs is a good script  written by good writers  and i think this film could be easily turned into an unforgettable classic about an aspect of male comingofage that is rarely treated in drama  all the elements that were so tedious and seemed so recherche in the film the messages written on the boy's belly  the leah scenes  the televisionscreen fantasies could become rich if underpinned with a good storyline i see in quite a few comments that people are talking of this film as somehow being about a gay subject  and i think that's mistaken  obviously  the crush depicted is that of a newly pubescent boy on an older adolescent boy  but the character of logan is far too young to have settled on any particular sexual choices  and  indeed  in his depicted masturbation fantasies  we see all sorts of stimuli  sexual and nonsexual  as we would expect in a very young boy like him  i believe crushes such as logan's are common

minutes without denigrating some other race or nationality than their own  and in terms that were repulsive and obscene  'fackin' pakis' and 'fackin' maceroons' were the small change of conversation

or a truly nice day it's hell with cockney nuances i suspect this programme must be sponsored by the everchanging it's perfect viewing for the depressed it doesn't cheer them up what it does do is present a whole community of such terminally despondent sadarses that viewers are moved to believe their lot really could be worse they might be living in 'albert square'apart from the above as a representation of london's east end it is pure hokum the programmemakers have evidently nos been across town the first thingy you encounter on the mile end road is a colossal mosque and this prettywell defines the racial majority of the population white british londoners are a dispersed and rapidly diminishing minority a large advertisement hoarding presently near the bow road flyover and sponsored by tower everchanging health empathetic boasts that 'eight out of ten members of the community can now see their doctor more quickly' ten healthy smiling faces beam down at the observer in confirmation eight of them are darkskinned what's more i used to work with a bunch of anglosaxon dare i say 'pukka' cockneys a few years ago and i can tell you that a more obnoxiously racist experience i've never had each day was like an oswald moseley rally they couldn't pass min without denigrating some other race or nationality than their own and in terms that were repulsive and obscene 'fackin' pakis' and 'fackin' maceroons' were the small change of conversation in fact their entire and extremely limited stock of adjectives fixated upon sexorgans and their application alf garnett was a paragon of liberal virtue in comparison any programme that purported to represent london's native eastend caucasians in their true nature would be completely unfit for broadcast even after the oclock watershed imagine a ku klux klan script written by quentin tarantino and you'd be somewhere near the mark but when they weren't being inveterate bigots they were at least extremely cheerful i don't know how such a soapopera came to be this imaginary castaway island of white misery has absolutely no bearing upon real culture whatsoever and if you're of a comparatively sanguine disposition it will quickly reduce you to tears of grief comparatively ordinary actors pretending to be comparatively ordinary chronicdepressives with cockney accents what's the point of that dull dreary unrelentingly disillusional and ethnically preposterous the most popular programme of an apparently diseased and dying nation avoid it like the

1,streisand fans only familiar with her work from the funny girl film onwards need to see this show to see what a brilliant performer streisand was  before she achieved her goal of becoming a movie star  there had never been a female singer quite like her ever before  and there never would be again sorry  celine  only in your dreams   but never again would streisand sing with the vibrancy  energy  and  above all  the enthusiasm and vulnerability with which she performs here  by the time she gets to that central park concert only or years later  she'd been filming funny girl in hollywood and her performing style has become less spontaneous and more reserved  more rehearsed and  let's face it  more angry  there's a wall between her and the audience  live performing was never what she really enjoyed  she did it because she knew it was her ticket to hollywood  and once she no longer had to do it she's done it as little as possible and oh  that legendary stage fright provides such a good excuse  her vocals here and on her earlier judy garland show appearance are incredible  streisand could truly make an old song sound new again  and composers such as richard rodgers and harold arlen loved her for it  but by the s streisand was trying to be a rock singer  her albums pandering to the younger audiences  with overwrought shrieking of songs that were unworthy of her effort or her voice  in the 's she came back with that brilliant broadway album  but went on and on about what a struggle it was to get it done  how they told her not to do it  etc  oh please  when has anyone told streisand what to do  she could have been doing good stuff like that all along  bringing audiences up to her level instead of stooping to what she thought the young public wanted  the back to broadway sequel wasn't nearly as good  as streisand seems to feel it necessary to improve on other composers' work  if he were alive at the time  would richard rodgers have even recognized his own some enchanted evening rodgers  notorious for taking singers to task for playing around with his melodies  would undoubtedly have been after streisand to sing what he'd written  she also blows michael crawford off the cd in their duet of music of the night  apparently reminding him just whose cd this is  why does she insist on taking songs that are duets and singing them by herself  and songs that aren't duets and singing them as duets with someone else who she then goes on to diminish supposedly judy garland took streisand aside and advised her  don't let them do to you what they did to me  advice streisand wasted no time in heeding  despite her protestations to the contrary  surely it looks like it's always been her way or the highway  just imagine  she told the cbs brass how her first tv special would be done  no guests  just her but nobody can argue with the results that are so evident here  treat yourself to this brilliant musical phenomenon before she was a legend  you'll be absolutely amazed at the difference ps  i watched this again last night    after not having seen it for many years  it was even better than i remembered  the st act begins with i'm late and includes make believe and how does the wine taste  and barbra's homage to childhood  i'm five  it climaxes as streisand appears with full and i mean full orchestra to sing people  she wasn't bored with the song yet and although it's a somewhat shorter rendition it really soars  compare it to some of her later autopilot versions  the nd act after streisand's kooky schtickpatter  which hasn't changed much over the years is the famous series of depression songs set amidst the extravagance of bergdorfgoodman's the rd act is the stunner  call it streisand  the orchestra  and the audience although we never see the audience that supposedly witness this historic event  with her fear of audiences and dislike of such performing  this may have been the toughest part for her  but if so  to her credit it doesn't show  she tears through lover come back to me and the torchy when the sun comes out though i can't remember in which order   the poignant why did i choose you  one of my alltime favorite streisand performances and offers a medley of funny girl songs  including of course don't rain on my parade and my favorite song from the score  the music that makes me dance explaining that fanny brice sang a song like that in and it made her the toast of broadway streisand then sings my man and it's almost a dressrehearsal template for her later screen rendition in the funny girl film the main difference being that the black gown here is sleeveless  her film gown had long sleeves and against the black background all we saw were her hands and face  but the vocal here is more urgent and charged than her later film vocal  her performance of the song has everything to do with streisand and nothing to do with fanny brice who  of course  never sang the song in such an allout manner as streisand does here or in the film  see the great ziegfield for a glimpse of brice's more understated version  the show ends with streisand singing happy days are here again over the credits when it

prowess  if the mechanics of movie making are what make a picture great  then yes  road to perdition is a distant cousin to the godfather in terms of what it achieves in cinematography  editing  music scoring and sound  what it doesn't have is a resonance that all great stories and some very rare movies have that stay with the viewer long after the experience of reading or seeing it is over  as with american beauty  there is a cold  distancing feel to this movie  despite some very tense scenes involving paternal love  loyalty and betrayal this story of a hit man tom hanks and his relationship to a surrogate father  figure who is also his boss  an elderly irish mob leader paul newman  seems to have been culled from innumerable gangster movies of years past  the father  son motif that hangs over this picture is so heavy handed in its treatment that there is not much room for spontaneity  the entire enterprise has been very carefully wrought  and nearly all the dialog is delivered with an air of great portent  this is obviously a gangster film  hence the requisite amount of violence and bloodshed  but the film is nearly devoid of any humor to speak of  only in scenes involving a young boy driving a getaway car in a cunningly edited montage is there any sense of lightheartedness to leaven the pervasive sense of doom that being said  i have nothing but the highest praise for the stunning look of this film  indeed  it is not an overstatement to say that this is one of the most beautifully photographed and designed movies i have ever seen  veteran cameraman conrad hall will very likely win another oscar for his work here  the production 's sets and costumes are just as exemplary  in fact  the entire film is a technical marvel  mr  mendes continues to astonish with his vivid use of color  and he and mr  hall again make very dramatic use of red blood splattered against pale colored walls  all the more effective and disconcerting due to the preponderance of blacks  blues and grays that dominate the movie's color scheme if i have failed to duly note the acting  it is not because the actors do not purport themselves ably  everyone in the film is top notch  with special mention going to the two malevolent bad guys  daniel craig is the classic man you love to hate the spoiled  impulsive son of newman's gangster father  and an almost unrecognizable jude law as an especially slimy miscreant who goes on pursuit of hanks and his son and figures very importantly in the film's riveting second half  but acting in a movie this dazzling

the understanding that it's actually a neosurrealist comedy  it's brilliant it works with good movies too  if jaws hadn't accepted the reality it created  the airtank explosion ending wouldn't have worked  but  a lot of people think jaws is vastly overrated for this type of reason  and they aren't wrong  but it has it's strengths  doesn't it  the point being that a movie like this makes sense if you look at it with the right perspective  some people  like me  get it right away  while others never will no matter how often it's explained  jim jarmusch made a compelling defense of showgirls once

the point  the movie accepts the stupidity of the characters much in the same way the jerk accepted navin johnson's idiocy  and because it takes that and runs with it  the movie focuses exclusively on using that to forward the plot and to define the characters  a bad movie would actually do this and fail to use that logic properly  bad movie are bad because they make it up as they go along  whereas movies like the stupids knows where it's going  what it's doing and why from the beginning i can't defend the film from an artistic standpoint  which is why i give it such a low rating  the acting is mostly bad  the jokes very superficial  and the liveaction quality probably ruins what would have worked as a cartoon  but i can't deny that it is entertaining in its own way  and that's why i defend it  i got it right away  and i pity those who don't i'll admit i was drawn to this movie because of christopher lee's delicious cameo appearance hearing him say release the drive bee  would have been worth the rental price even if i hated this film  but was amazed to find that  aside from the tv studio applause sign segment with jenny mccarthy  i was never bored  and never disappointed  in fact  many of the jokes  because of their cartoonish context  were hilarious in particular the airbagcigarette explosion  they were dumb  but they were funny  and the movie doesn't pretend to be anything else  a stupid comedy about stupid characters and instead of apologizing for it  it enjoys itself and that's exactly why it works ,0.17181655764579773,1,this is probably the only film i've seen where the imdb reviews on both sides of the spectrum are accurate the stupids is an grisly dimwitted film with absolutely no artistic merit whatsoever and is a denigration to a director like john landis and that's what makes it great in order to appreciate the stupids you have to keep in mind a littleknown but very true maxim chatted by director abo kyrou i urge you to learn to look at bad films they are

must say  throughout the entire movie  it seemed as though no one knew what they were doing  every joke fell flat  and every opportunity for a genuinely funny gag went ignored  the dialogue was bland

overall disposition has changed  and it falls into almost all of the pitfalls that plague bad anime  seven or eight friends and myself started watching this series on tv  by the end  only one friend and i were still watching and neither of us liked it allow me to explain the plot for you  you can skip this paragraph if you don't want to know  kagome is an average high school student  who one day falls into a magical well near her family run shrine  when kagome comes out of the well again  she has been transported back in time to the feudal era of japan  she meets up with many other characters and they form a group of five or so companions who set off on a journey of revenge  justice  groping in one characters case  overall  they are trying to recover the pieces of the sacred jewel shard which enhances the power of demons who use it while there are many  many side stories and story arcs  there is no were near enough material to occupy episodes  the only story arc that is interesting enough to watch is still sort of dull the band of seven  after the half way mark in the series or maybe even before  it becomes painfully obvious that the plot is frozen in place and whoever made the series decided instead to put in dozens and dozens of filler episodes  these episodes have little to no impact on the story  and rarely even on the characters  in some cases  some characters who had an important role in the story will disappear for dozens of episodes at a time  many episodes follow the exact same cookie cutter patterns as the stories before it  inuyasha shoots windscar at enemy  windscar deflects  characters gasp in horror  enemy turns out to have barrier  characters spent three episodes trying to kill enemy before kagome finally fires sacred arrow at him and he turns to dust  also major spoiler  the conclusion will be revealed the lack of any conclusion makes it seem like you have waisted hours  major spoiler overthe animation itself is above average  and in some cases excellent  even so  reused animation cells plague most action scenes  and it is very hard to ignore them when it is clear that the exact same boulder has flown past a character five or six times in a row on the brighter side however  all of the characters are very well developed and the romances between some of the characters were truly captivating  also  the character designs  appearences  were brilliant and at times among the best i have seen  particularly with the band of seven  there is definitely no shortage of cosplay opportunities here  even so  i found myself hoping that a character would die just so there would be some sort of movement in the plot  and some of the humour in the show between characters is used again and again  one particular joke sit boy is found within the first five episodes  and you can literally expect it to be used again and again for the remaining episodes although there are some good aspects of the show and it is easy to see why it has a huge following  the series seems to be dominated by obsessed fan girls who drool over sesshomiru and inuyasha bottom line  definitely worth checking out  but not worth watching the whole series  the first episodes are very clever  original and enjoyable for anybody  but after that  it simply becomes dull and tedious  watching a tv show should never feel like a chore  but somehow this series accomplishes just

1,bill crain's rarer than rare 'slasher' movie certainly doesn't follow the standard stalk and slash guidelines that have become so essential of its counterparts  the bogeyman this time around uses grenades and small arms as well as an awesome array of melee weapons   a sin that's virtually unacceptable in most posthalloween genre pieces  but there's still just enough familiarity to keep slasher buffs from checking the rule book and the plot never strays too far from the path that you've grown to expect  just as wally koz's surprisingly decent was seemingly put together with help from various members of his family  mirage seems to have been a joint production from relatives of the director  looking through the credits i noticed numerous 'crains' listed in key positions throughout the construction of the feature  but despite fairly good distribution across the globe  the movie failed to make an impression either side of the atlantic and now it has become pretty much a phantom of the vhs market  nevertheless this only made it appeal to me even more and so i strained my resources to track a copy down it all takes place in the middle of the dessert  which as i'm sure you'll agree is hardly the most exciting location  with that said though  i must admit that there's certainly going to be no chance of any nosey john q laws turning up unexpectedly  four undeniably beautiful youngsters head out into the sand for a night of debauchery and frolics that always seems to rub homicidal maniacs the wrong way  chris jennifer mcallister and her boyfriend greg kenny johnson meet up with amusing new age hippies trip kevin mcparland and mary nicole anton at a make shift camp site in the midst of the dunelike wilderness  greg's older brother kyle todd schaefer and his buxom girlfriend bambi laura albert soon turn up to join the body count applicants in their quest for an early grave  kyle used to date chris before his younger brother took the liberty of stealing his squeeze  something that kyle doesn't seem too keen to forget  sound like a motive for a massacre  well what did you expect  before long an unseen someone driving a truck with tinted windows joins the gathering with a unique set of tricks up his sleeve  will any of the kids survive to turn up for a sequel  i have had trouble tracking down any information at all about this feature  i don't even know if director bill crain is aka william crain  the man behind midnight fear and blacula among others  mirage certainly doesn't appear on his official filmography  so your guess is as good as mine  judging by the credible work behind the camera  i'd have to say that i find it hard to believe that this is the debut of a man with no previous cinematic experience  the film is stylishly photographed with some superb work from dp michael crain  and the director boasts a credible talent for building suspense when it's necessary  r  christopher biggs' gore fx are imaginatively created and gruesome  and kudos to the sleepy head over at the bbfc who inexplicably let this pass through uncut on a usually stringent rating  a couple of the murders are indeed extremely macabre  one guy gets buried up to his neck in sand before coming face to face with a grenade  while another ends up literally legless after loosing a battle with a chain and a pick up truck  there's also some black humor that's surely unintentional  we spend the majority of the feature seeing only the killer's boots as he steps out of his vehicle and stalks the youngsters  but when he's revealed to hilariously resemble keanu reeves circa bill and ted's bogus journey  i didn't quite know what to expect  thankfully crain knows exactly how to keep things creepy and the showdown is particularly mean spirited as the psycho taunts chris sadistically there are some surprisingly good performances on display from an extremely inexperienced cast  the divine jennifer mcallister does a superb job as the heroine and b g  steers portrays off his rocker dementia with finesse  the casting director chose wisely to pick some of the most beautiful females ever slaughtered in slasher cinema and it gratefully doesn't come at the cost of thespian potential  the soundtrack works well to build the desolate atmosphere of isolation  which is carefully handled by a director that should have been signed and nurtured by hollywood bigwigs  watch out for the superb nightmare sequence that is truly horror filmmaking at it's freakiest mirage is a good late entry to the cycle that was somewhat unfortunate to miss a boom year placing amongst the slasher elite  when you consider that this was made with just a cast of seven and a pick up truck  you have to say that they did a damn good job  the flaws are numerous  but never detract credibility from the net result  unfortunately you've probably got more chance of finding liquid gold in your coffee mug than you have of ever tracking down a copy  if you see this one covered

virtually unacceptable in most posthalloween genre pieces but there's still just enough acquaintance to keep thrillers buffs from checking the rule book and the plot never strays too far from the path that you've grown to expect just as wally koz's surprisingly decent was seemingly put together with help from various members of his family mirage seems to have been a joint production from relatives of the director looking through the credits i noticed numerous 'crains' listed in key positions throughout the construction of the feature but despite fairly good distribution across the globe the movie failed to make an impression either side of the atlantic and now it has become pretty much a phantom of the vhs market nevertheless this only made it appeal to me even more and so i strained my resources to track a copy down it all takes place in the middle of the dessert which as i'm sure you'll endorse is hardly the most exciting location with that said albeit i must admit that there's certainly going to be no chance of any nosey john q laws turning up unexpectedly four undeniably beautiful youngsters head out into the sand for a night of debauchery and frolics that always seems to rub homicidal maniacs the wrong way chris jennifer mcallister and her boyfriend greg kenny johnson meet up with amusing novel age hippies trip kevin mcparland and mary nicole anton at a make shift camp site in the midst of the dunelike wilderness greg's older brother kyle todd schaefer and his buxom girlfriend bambi laura albert soon turn up to join the body count applicants in their quest for an early grave kyle used to date chris before his younger brother took the liberty of stealing his squeeze  something that kyle doesn't seem too keen to forget sound like a motive for a massacre well what did you expect before long an unseen someone driving a truck with tinted windows joins the gathering with a unique set of tricks up his sleeve will any of the kids survive to turn up for a sequel i have had trouble tracking down any information at all about this feature i don't even know if director bill crain is aka william crain  the man behind midnight fear and blacula among others mirage certainly doesn't appear on his official filmography so your guess is as good as mine judging by the credible work behind the camera i'd have to say that i find it hard to believe that this is the debut of a man with no previous cinematic experience the film is stylishly photographed with some superb work from dp michael crain and the director boasts a credible talent for building suspense when it's necessary r christopher biggs' gore fx are imaginatively created and gruesome and kudos to the sleepy head over at the bbfc who inexplicably let this pass through uncut on a usually stringent rating a couple of the murders are indeed extremely macabre one guy gets buried up to his neck in sand before coming face to face with a grenade while another ends up literally legless after loosing a battle with a chain and a pick up truck there's also some black humor that's surely unintentional we spend the majority of the feature seeing only the killer's boots as he steps out of his vehicle and stalks the youngsters but when he's revealed to hilariously resemble keanu reeves circa bill and ted's bogus journey i didn't quite know what to expect thankfully crain knows exactly how to keep things creepy and the showdown is particularly mean spirited as the psycho taunts chris sadistically there are some surprisingly good performances on display from an extremely inexperienced cast the divine jennifer mcallister does a superb job as the heroine and b g steers portrays off his rocker dementia with finesse the casting director chose wisely to pick some of the most beautiful females ever slaughtered in slasher cinema and it gratefully doesn't come at the cost of thespian potential the soundtrack works well to build the desolate atmosphere of isolation which is carefully handled by a director that should have been signed and nurtured by hollywood bigwigs watch out for the superb nightmare sequence that is truly horror filmmaking at it's freakiest mirage is a good late entry to the cycle that was somewhat unfortunate to miss a boom year placing amongst the slasher elite when you consider that this was made with just a cast of seven and a pick up truck you have to say that they did a damn good job the flaws are numerous but never detract credibility from the net result unfortunately you've probably got more chance of finding liquid gold in your coffee mug than you have of ever tracking down a copy if you see this one covered in dust on the top shelf of your local video store then make sure you pick it up recommended,0.4519051611423493,7,0.9878751739216856,Y,0.01

after i saw the ads for it  i ended up seeing it only by chance because some friends of mine had tickets and had one spare so i tagged along  before seeing it i had a fairly good idea that it wouldn't be genius  the premise seemed far too silly and stupid for anything good to come out of it  but at the back of my mind i was thinking but there must be something good about it for uma thurman and luke wilson do to the film   not that i think either of them are particularly terrific but they are bignamed stars who would normally only do films that would enhance their reputations  however  about minutes into the feature i realized that the movie was probably worse than i had at first anticipated  i was shocked at how terrible the script was  it really gave the actors nothing to work with  so much so that they really looked like they didn't know what they were doing especially luke wilson  the story was completely predictable  if you've seen the ad then you've pretty much seen the movie  and there was nothing original about it  it pretty much borrows from every 'superhero' story that has ever been which would be acceptable had the film been set up as a satire of that genre  but alas it wasn't  the direction seemed to be of realism  i got the feeling that the director wanted the film to feel completely realistic and not satire at all  and yet there were some moments in the film that were so unbelievably unrealistic that it would have worked if it were a satire  at one moment in the movie two of the characters seem to die and one of the surviving characters has a line like oh well  she's dead  time to move on and he says it in such a droll voice that it completely didn't make any sense  i found myself checking my watch after about minutes to see how much longer i would have to sit through it  and then it struck me  i began to think i wonder if the studio have made this picture as a test to see if they can make the worst possible movie ever made  and still pull a large audience   i couldn't think of any other reason why this film would be made  for movies to be made these days  the script goes to a massive screening process and very very few scripts actually make it to the production stage  i can't comprehend how this one got past the first draft stage  by the end  and exceedingly  dumbfoundingly stupid climax  i was laughing heartily  just not at what the filmmakers wanted me to laugh at  but instead at how ridiculous and stupid the movie was  thank god i didn't have to pay money to see it  because that would have really annoyed me  oh  and could i just add  that of the two wilson brothers  i have always preferred luke because i think he is a better  more versatile actor  but if he wants to step even further into owen's shadow then this is exactly the way to do it  i doubt that he will get many more job offers after this crappy waste of hours  and remember  it only got a generous  because i couldn't select ,0.013566590845584871,1,first

seem to be something one would find on a canvas  framed and hung in a museum or on the walls of an eccentric's home  the costumes were gorgeous and  despite not being the most comfortable clothes in the world  made me want to find a seamstress to create such garb for myself  the whole movie was set on the picturesque lake geneva where i hope to one day go because of seeing this movie and the serenity that these historical figures found there this movie shows  besides the tranquility found by all the escapees of england's harsh judgements  the strangeness that surrounded this adventure as

1,few would argue that master animation director hayao miyazaki is one of the few to hold this ability no  too many are focused on john lassiter's amazing ability to steal other movies plots  turn them into pretty puppet shows and then be lauded as a genius    but i digress miyazaki has given us film after film that deals with important mature issues usually ecologically themed  and has an

a year old woman my mother able to connect with the mother characters and i'm betting the older charas too and loving the cuteness of the child characters and that is what i respect most about miyazakisan  he seems to speak to his audience in a completely different way than the average filmmaker  on the surface  ponyo could be seen as a simple story about a little fishgirl who gets a taste of the human world and wants to join it and the friend she makes there  a little boy names soske somewhat like the little mermaid  but there is an entire different level at play here  true to form  miyazaki populates his film with intensely strong female characters ponyo's mother  soske's mother  the older ladies in a nursing home are all genuine characters with minds of their own and extremely strong willed but the girl who takes the cake is ponyo herself  once she decides that she likes the human world  she simply uses her own will to achieve her dreams  her father is trying to keep her innocent  and keep her a magical fish  but young ponyo knows what she wants and becomes human out of simply her own determination  once human  she teams up with her friend  soske  whom she loves very much although maybe not as much as ham  soske is asked to be the man of the house at age five when his mother lisa decides she has to help the people at the rest home where she works during a typhoon that has been inadvertently caused by ponyo on her quest to become human  frankie jonas yes  he's related to the jonas brothers  can we just get past that please  gives  perhaps  the best performance in the film as young soske which is good since he has the most lines  his character is also strong willed  but also very respectful and friendly characteristics you're not likely to find in a child character on this side of the pacific in the end  ponyo's father  fujimoto must cope with his daughter's decision and his estranges wife's wishes to allow her to be human  he hopes that ponyo and soske will remember him fondly  and once again  miyazaki refuses to allow a character to become the stereotypical bad guy  although miyazaki has for some reason received some criticism for this  it is  honestly  what makes his movies magical and yet relatable  no one in real life is completely a bad person  all humans are various shades of gray  and that is exactly what miyazaki does with his characters  and then there's the animation itself  in a time when cgi would certainly have helped with the copious amounts of effects shots in this film  especially the water  miyazaki has chosen to incorporate no cgi whatsoever  certainly the hand drawn animation was colored by digital means  but every film in this was handdrawn and i  for one  was extremely grateful for that  the character animation was extremely fluid  and there even appeared to be some lipsync going on quite unusual for an anime film  the backgrounds seemed to be rendered with colored pencil and had an effect all its own on the audience  this is what animation used to look like and what it should look like  in the end  i found ponyo to be thoroughly enjoyable  certainly not miyazaki's best in my opinion  that

nobody in his right mind crushes out a cigarette in a handkerchief and sticks it in his pocket  this whole sequence just made cooper seem foolish and gauche  it is a poor contrivance  ill conceived and filmed in a way that induces ridicule not laughter  the forced medical examination of cooper is equally contrived  nobody lets himself undergo a complete medical examination without his being advised of its purpose or giving his consent  that cooper did so is too removed from reality to be funny  it's absurd  stealing babies from hospitals is a serious legal offense  and that  too  is nothing to laugh about  finally  the scenes of cooper's overly fastidious  neurotic attention to his baby's feeding and weight may have struck a nerve with a few people who have experienced anxiety over their own newborn babies  but to me they just seem tedious and slow  the wardrobe and prop departments went over the top in those scenes  while paradoxically  the script writer went to sleep the lines are just not in the script to generate humor  they just miss on all cylinders  the laughs come not a mileaminute  but more like a light yearaminute  the only time the movie has any energy or humor is when frank morgan is on camera the scene that is totally wasted is when both of cooper's love interests and their respective fathers are cooped up in the same hotel room together  there is probably a rich vein of humor somewhere in that mine  but none of it was extracted in the end  one of the two very likable girls is going to get hurt  predictably  it is the anita louise character

1,i love midnight cowboy and have it in my video collection as it is a favorite of mine  what is interesting to me is how when midnight cowboy came out in it was so shocking to viewers that it was rated x  of course  at that time x meant maturity  since i was only two years old at the time of the movie's release  it is hard for me to imagine just how shocked viewers were back then  however  when i try to take into account that many of the topics covered in the film  which included prostitution the title itself was slang for a male prostitute homosexuality  loneliness  physical and to some extent emotional as well abuse and drugs are hard for many people to talk about to this day  i can begin to get a sense of what viewers of this movie thought back on its release  it is worth noting that in the 's  midnight cowboy was downgraded to an r rating and even though it is still rated r  some of the scenes could almost be rated pg by today's standards i want to briefly give a synopsis of the plot although it is probably known to almost anyone who has heard of the movie  jon voight plays a young man named joe buck from texas who decides that he can make it big as a male hustler in new york city escorting rich women  he emulates cowboy actors like roy rogers by wearing a cowboy outfit thinking that that will impress women  after being rejected by all the women he has come across  he meets a sleazy conman named enrico ratso rizzo who is played by dustin hoffman  ratso convinces joe that he can make all kinds of money if he has a manager  once again  joe is conned and before long is homeless  however  joe comes across ratso and is invited to stay in a dilapidated apartment  without giving away much more of the plot  i want to say that the remainder of the movie deals with joe and ratso as they try to help one another in an attempt to fulfill their dreams  i e  joe making it as a gigolo and ratso going down to florida where he thinks he can regain his health i want to make some comments about the movie itself  first of all  the acting is excellent  especially the leads  although the movie is really very sad from the beginning to the end  there are some classic scenes  in fact  there are some scenes that while they are not intended to be funny  i find them amusing  for example  there is the classic scene where dustin hoffman and jon voight are walking down a city street and a cab practically runs them over  dustin hoffman bangs on the cab and says hey  i'm walkin' here  i'm walkin' here  i get a kick out of that scene because it is so typical of new york city where so many people are in a hurry  another scene that comes to mind is the scene where ratso dustin hoffman sends joe jon voight to a guy named o'daniel  what is amusing is that at first  we think o'daniel is there to recruit gigolos and can see why joe is getting so excited but then we begin to realize that o'daniel is nothing but a religious nut  in addition to the two scenes i mentioned  i love the scene where ratso and joe are arguing in their apartment when ratso says to joe that his cowboy outfit only attracts homosexuals and joe says in selfdefense john wayne  you gonna tell me he's a fag  what i like is the delivery in that scene i would say that even though midnight cowboy was set in the late ''s  much of it rings true today  that's because although the area around nd street in new york has been cleaned up in the form of disneyfication in the last several years  homelessness is still just as prevalent there now as it was years ago  also  many people have unrealistic dreams of how they are going to strike it big only to have their dreams smashed as was the case with the jon voight character  one thing that impresses me about jon voight's character is how he is a survivor and i felt that at the end of the movie  he had matured a great deal and that ratso dustin hoffman's character was a good influence on him in conclusion  i want to say that i suggest that when watching this movie  one should watch it at least a couple of times because there are so many things that go on  for example  there are a bunch of flashback and dream sequences that made more sense to me after a couple of viewings  also  what i find interesting is that there is a lot in this movie that is left to interpretation such as what really happened with joe buck jon

love midnight cowboy and have it in my video collecting as it is a favorite of mine what is interesting to me is how when midnight cowboy came out in it was so appalling to viewers that it was rated x of course at that time x meant maturity since i was only two years archaic at the time of the movie's release it is hard for me to imagine just how shocked viewers were backwards then however when i try to take into account that many of the topics covered in the film which included prostitution the title itself was slang for a male prostitute homosexuality loneliness physical and to some extent emotional as well abuse and drugs are hard for many people to talk about to this jour i can begin to get a sense of what viewers of this movie thought backwards on its release it is worth referring that in the 's midnight cowboy was downgraded to an r rating and even though it is still classed r some of the visuals could almost be rated pg by today's standards i want to briefly afford a synopsis of the plot although it is presumably known to almost anyone who has heard of the movie jon voight plays a young man named joe buck from tex who decides that he can make it big as a mens hustler in new york city escorting rich women he emulates cowboy actors like roy rogers by wearing a cowboy outfit thinking that that will impress women after being rejected by all the women he has come across he meets a sleazy shyster designated enrico ratso explainable who is played by dustin hoffman ratso convinces joe that he can make all kinds of money if he has a manager once again joe is conned and before long is homeless however joe comes across ratso and is invited to stay in a dilapidated apartment without giving away much more of the plot i want to say that the remainder of the movie deals with joe and ratso as they try to help one another in an attempt to fulfill their dreams i e joe making it as a gigolo and ratso going down to florida where he thinks he can regain his health i want to make some comments about the movie itself first of all the acting is excellent especially the leads although the movie is really very sad from the beginning to the end there are some classic scenes in fact there are some scenes that while they are not intended to be funny i find them amusing for example there is the classic scene where dustin hoffman and jon voight are walking down a city street and a cab practically runs them over dustin hoffman bangs on the cab and says hey i'm walkin' here i'm walkin' here i get a kick out of that scene because it is so typical of new york city where so many people are in a hurry another scene that comes to mind is the scene where ratso dustin hoffman sends joe jon voight to a guy named o'daniel what is amusing is that at first we think o'daniel is there to recruit gigolos and can see why joe is getting so excited but then we begin to realize that o'daniel is nothing but a religious nut in addition to the two scenes i mentioned i love the scene where ratso and joe are arguing in their apartment when ratso says to joe that his cowboy outfit only attracts homosexuals and joe says in selfdefense john wayne you gonna tell me he's a fag what i like is the delivery in that scene i would say that even though midnight cowboy was set in the late ''s much of it rings true today that's because although the area around nd street in new york has been cleaned up in the form of disneyfication in the last several years homelessness is still just as prevalent there now as it was years ago also many people have unrealistic dreams of how they are going to strike it big only to have their dreams smashed as was the case with the jon voight character one thing that impresses me about jon voight's character is how he is a survivor and i felt that

easy on the eyes  the film at least has the dignity to bowl along at a reasonable pace  but its biggest plus is that the octopus isn't entirely cgi rendered  so even though it doesn't look good  at least there are a few legit scenes of characters inanely grappling with rubbery tentacles in pretty amusing fashion  i also chuckled at the disparities between different representations of the octopus  the cgi shots of the creature as a whole vary over the course of the film  they are also different not only in size but appearance to the practical shots of it  and there are scenes where the tentacle action suggests that the makers had abandoned pretending they were making a film about an octopus and just envisioned their creature as a bunch of miscellaneous tentacles  the scenes of the creature attacking people get old pretty swiftly  but there are a few funny scenes where it takes on other things  like a boat and a crane  yes  these scenes are poor  but they did make me chuckle  undisputable highlight though is a hilarious sequence in which the octopus takes on a new york landmark  the scene may not be much more than a minute but it really is inspired  and well worth looking up on youtube  apart from that things are uninspired all round  a pg level lack of gore or nastiness stops this one from even pulling off much in the trash good times the film does take a turn into semi gripping disaster movie territory at the end  but i can't really give it credit because the best shots in the last few scenes were culled from the stallone flick daylight which by my recollection is quite good  altogether this was pretty rubbishy stuff and not something i'd really recommend to anyone except creature feature die hards  better than a poke in the eye with a wet stick  but not by

and well worth looking up on youtube apart from that things are uninspired all round a pg level lack of gore or nastiness stops this one from even pulling off much in the trash good times the film does take a turn into semi gripping disaster movie territory at the end but i can't really give it credit because the best shots in the last few scenes were culled from the stallone flick daylight which by my recollection is quite good altogether this was pretty rubbishy stuff and not something i'd really recommend to anyone except creature feature die hards better than a poke in the eye with a wet stick but not by much,0.6567152738571167,20,0.9539716449796076,Y,0.04

character in this reality dance macabre gives a creepy kid a bottle of max von sydow holy water and reassures him by telling this boy that he  too  had a unspecified bad experience as a child with things that came out of the closet and the  catholic  church gave him a holy water to fend off the things coming out of the closet i knew i should have given monday night football another shot the shtick behind paranormal state is a group of penn state students all got together and started their own ghost hunting club  or society  or super adventure club  and they run around pennsylvania researching the most terrible hauntings and the lost plot to an m  night shymalan movie the they is kind of a misnomer  really paranormal state revolves around a nittany lion named ryan buell who would probably be running penn state's yearly anime convention if it wasn't for this show  he is often accompanied on investigations by hot coeds and some other people seen in the credits but rarely caught on camera  hey  are they ghosts too  this is ryan buell's show  paranormal state is his vehicle as we like to say in the biz  and  oh  what a dull ride in a vehicle he can be did i mention ryan narrates the entire episode of paranormal state in a star dateless director's log voice over  almost immediately that gets annoying because the obvious intention is to give ryan's ghost hunting some gravitas  but his filtered monotone does nothing but provoke grunts and laughs  seriously  every serious intonation sounds like the radio chatter from a call of duty video game the investigations  the plot that each episode revolves around  are interesting on the surface  no haunted inns or restaurants to be found in paranormal state this is a show about fearing the unknown like a good catholic boy and by god they give you stuff to fear  small children are harassed  things loom in the dark  voices encourage the living to kill  and the aleister crowely in me rubs my hands  of the two episodes i watched each revolved around violent  nasty hauntings tied to violent  nasty deaths  maybe maybe not  everything in paranormal state is shorthanded into half hour  dog the bounty  er  ghost hunter blocks  every time there is an interesting  verifiable shred of evidence  the murder of a family in a farmhouse in the s  the proof is waved in front of the viewer like a con artist trying to convince you a stack of papers currently under your nose is proof of that ten million coming from nigeria and then yanked away before you can get a good gander  at least with scifi channel's ghost hunters there is a somewhat overexhaustive need to trot out every possible shred of evidence and present it to the viewer  evps that could be a rat farting  cold spots in a drafty house  and orbs that even the ghost hunters themselves discount as dust  it is a sort of scooby doo like approach that makes ghost hunters  almost believable whereas paranormal state claims to have evps but gives the viewer a ten second video clip of a wave file in garage band with no audio  yep  see  an evp  right  people are claiming to see dark figures in the basement  well  we will just go and see about that  while leaving the night vision camera on an enthralling stationary shot of the living room  ryan  the intrepid leader of this pack of penn state graduates  is claiming to see visions of a demon's name he knows and that might be involved in a paranormal haunting  but he can't tell us  the audience  or his team of gothed out undergrads  because  he can't  you never say a demon's name out loud  ryan informs the wide eyed coed who dare inquires well  how very very convenient for you  especially since this is a television show where the audience cannot read your mind paranormal state is all turn and no prestige  the audience gets told what is supposedly happening but you never see an ounce of proof that the creepy kid is seeing dead people  not even grainy video of a chair moving  or a black blob running between prison cells  nothing  you are just told what happened by ryan in yet another mechanical voice over if you are going to try and spook me dress it up a little  if you are trying to sway me  show me a orb or a blob and have the fat chick who works days at hot topic tell me why that black orb is really the spirit of an ax murderer  and if you want to make me watch a ghost hunting show give me something besides trotting out lorraine warren by the second episode paranormal state is weak sauce  not really worth watching unless you are hard up for tv time  or just have that thin

state is his vehicle as we like to say in the biz and oh what a dull ride in a vehicle he can be did i mention everchanging narrates the totality episode of uncanny state in a star dateless director's log voice over almost immediately that gets annoying because the obvious intention is to give ryan's ghost hunting some gravitas but his filtered monotone does nothing but provoke grunts and laughs seriously every serious intonation sounds like the radio chatter from a call of duty video game the investigations the plot that each episode revolves around are interesting on the surface no haunted inns or restaurants to be found in paranormal state this is a show about fearing the unknown like a good catholic boy and by god they give you stuff to fear small children are harassed things loom in the dark voices encourage the living to kill and the aleister crowely in me rubs my hands of the two episodes i watched each revolved around violent nasty hauntings tied to violent nasty deaths maybe maybe not everything in paranormal state is shorthanded into half hour dog the bounty er ghost hunter blocks every time there is an interesting verifiable shred of evidence the murder of a family in a farmhouse in the s the proof is waved in front of the viewer like a con artist trying to convince you a stack of papers currently under your nose is proof of that ten million coming from nigeria and then yanked away before you can get a good gander at least with scifi channel's ghost hunters there is a somewhat overexhaustive need to trot out every possible shred of evidence and present it to the viewer evps that could be a rat farting cold spots in a drafty house and orbs that even the ghost hunters themselves discount as dust it is a sort of scooby doo like approach that makes ghost hunters almost believable whereas paranormal state claims to have evps but gives the viewer a ten second video clip of a wave file in garage band with no audio yep see an evp right people are claiming to see dark figures in the basement well we will just go and see about that while leaving the night vision camera on an enthralling stationary shot of the living room ryan the intrepid leader of this pack of penn state graduates is claiming to see visions of a demon's name he knows and that might be involved in a paranormal haunting but he can't tell us the audience or his team of gothed out undergrads because he can't you never say a demon's name out loud ryan informs the wide eyed coed who dare inquires well how very very convenient for you especially since this is a television show where the audience cannot read your mind paranormal state is all turn and no prestige the audience gets told what is supposedly happening but you never see an ounce of proof that the creepy kid is seeing dead people not even grainy video of a chair moving or a black blob running between prison cells nothing you are just told what happened by ryan in yet another mechanical voice over if you are going to try and spook me dress it up a little if you are trying to sway me show me a orb or a blob and have the fat chick who works days at hot topic tell me why that black orb is really the spirit of an ax murderer and if you want to make me watch a ghost hunting show give me something besides trotting out lorraine warren by the second episode paranormal state is weak sauce not really worth watching unless you are hard up for tv time or just have that thin of a dvd collection or unless you want to know what really happened in that closet with the holy

0,a frustrating documentary  louis kahn's son  who saw his father only minimally during his childhood because he was a member of just one of the three separate families his father had created  takes on the task of trying to learn more about his father through an exploration of his architecture and his life  it sounds like a great idea for a documentary  but it ends up flat and uninteresting sadly  the basic problem is that kahn's son  nathaniel  is not just one of the film's protagonists  he is also director  writer  producer  interviewer and narrator  nathaniel seems both too inexperienced and possibly too close to the material to function well in any of these roles  further  while he seems like a nice enough guy  he doesn't have much screen presence  so the fact that he is the only constant in the film becomes wearing  nathaniel also comes across as an unprepared and amateurish interviewer  there are several points where an interviewee makes an interesting or provocative statement and the camera cuts to a shot of nathaniel offering little more than a blank stare and a sort of timid uhhuh  as if he's a little panicked that he's going to have to come up with something to say in response  at times  i felt embarrassed watching people who might have had truly interesting things to say about kahn or at least better things to do with their time seeming to realize that they were in the hands of an interviewer who was going to rely on them to direct the conversation  nathaniel's dual role as both documentarian and lost son seem to do more to hurt the film than help  one senses that some of the interviewees are a little reluctant to really open up about negative aspects of kahn's personality and career  presumably because it's not clear from nathaniel whether he's looking to dig into the truth or simply wants to hear nice stories about his dad  preferably ones that will confirm his hope that his dad really did care more for nathaniel and his mother than seems likely  his passive approach as an interviewer may stem directly from this conflict  the only person nathaniel does push is his own mother  but those conversations tend to feel a little like bad teen drama aren't you angry  mom  and don't offer much in terms of helping us or nathaniel understand kahn or the loyalty he evoked from those around him  what the film desperately lacks is shaping by an experienced and independent hand  not to exclude nathaniel  but to balance his subjectivity and inexperience  an independent director could have stood away from the material  given more thought to what the interviewees could contribute and  one hopes  cut out those portions of the documentary process that just don't work  such as the weird segment with the guy who claims to have see kahn die which made it look as if nathaniel was just being taken in by some loony or the entire bit about hooking up with kahn's first cousin  who had nothing to add about kahn or nathaniel  too many times nathaniel makes us watch him standing in or near a kahn building buttonholing strangers to tell them that his father was the designer  ah huh  thaaat's nice  sir  umm i gotta go now  i understand why these things might be important to nathaniel and that showing the documentary process is sometimes interesting  but this is one of those examples of when a documentary can be too personal as an aside  i thought the score written for the film was great  but  one of the oddest moments in the entire thing for me was when  during the tour of the kimball art museum  the voiceover quotes kahn as making a comparison between architecture and beethoven's fifth symphony  the music being played at the same time  beethoven's ninth symphony  a mistake  a miscue  who knows  it did make me laugh  kahn was a great architect and it's clear that he was an unusual human being and had an intriguing life story  there's definitely a good documentary to be made about him  one is sympathetic to nathaniel's search for the father he didn't know  but i'm not sure whether that is an interesting story  neither works so well in this film ,0.01465275976806879,1,a depressing documentary louis kahn's son who noticed

1,i would probably not have bothered to comment on this film if i had not been disturbed by the constant references made to it here in north america as a porn film  our obsession with what is  or should be  regarded as pornographic remains a relic of the 'guidance' provided to film makers by the hayes committee many  many years ago and it is now really time that we relegate it to the past  so far we have not progressed far beyond establishing a somewhat arbitrary division between what we now term 'soft' and 'hard' porn  with both carrying the same pornography label  it is time for us all recognise that neither the r rated soft porn  release version of this film  nor the unrated version hard porn  available on dvd were in any way pornographic in legal terms pornography is defined by its capacity to deprave or corrupt  many classic books such as lady chatterley's lover  fanny hill  women in love  the story of 'o' or moll flanders have been prosecuted for pornographic content  tried by jury and cleared on the basis of this definition  but in practice most ordinary citizens are not interested in what they regard as legal equivocation  and apply a simpler test that is rather too stringent when applied to books or films which are very close to the line  but serves to quickly clear most others from any taint of pornography  although the hayes code would have rated aiw as unacceptable both for nudity and for its depictions of sexual activities  in practice most people today accept that where the basic message of a book or film is clearly designed to encourage the development of long term stable family relationships in which the participants find real fulfillment  it cannot be regarded as pornographic this does not mean that works depicting unsatisfactory or unstable relationships should be recognised as pornographic  only that these may need a more sophisticated assessment  in aiw  we have a film about a young female librarian who has had a rather sheltered upbringing  and keeps her suitor at arms length because of a feeling that this is what morality requires her to do  after he gets too frustrated by this and threatens to leave her  she falls asleep and dreams she is transported to a wonderland closely based on that of lewis carrol where everyone she meets is totally uninhibited about their sexual needs  she is shocked  but is a kind person who takes things as she finds them  so before long she finds her own prejudices gradually melting away  she wakes up when her boyfriend returns to break off their affair  but her attitude to him has changed so completely that their relationship is fully restored  and the film ends with them living 'happily ever after' with their children in a home with a white picket fence and a family dog  an ending clearly directed to those romantics who remain very young at heart pornographic   hardly  suitable viewing for children   well probably not quite  unless they have very progressive parents r rating   pg would be more appropriate today entertaining for viewers in most age groups   yes  but the film has its faults  these are discussed in many of the comments here on imdb  however most commentators clearly appreciated and enjoyed it i believe the only pornography associated with this film was the reported claim by an antipornography activist of scientific proof that a magazine picture of kristin debell was a photographic montage of images of the face of a ten year old with various body parts of adult models  these and other comments seriously damaged the career of a very promising young actress  but today the film appears to be on its way to becoming a cult classic  several home video productions have been released in both vhs and dvd format  the last was a dvd containing both the r rated and unrated versions of the film  released by subversive cinema in copies of this were readily available until a few months ago  now they are almost exhausted and the mail order vendors who still have copies in stock are selling them at many times their original price  a situation which usually quickly results in a new dvd release appearing  this continuing interest nearly years after the original film was released points to near classic status commentators on this database are expected to provide fellow viewers with useful guidance on whether a film is worth

originating with the hayes committee  on this database such general comments are very quickly marked by readers as 'not helpful' and i seldom make them  but fortunately i still have space to add that

bangladesh is clearly the biggest a teary local architect hails kahn for having created a building where democracy may and hopefully will flourish fellow architect moshe safdie opines that there might have been something fitting in kahn's suffering a mortal heart attack in a train station given his incessant globetrotting i disagree it's sadly ironic that kahn should die in the faceless replacement for one of america's true architectural gems the old pennsylvania station wrecked to make way for a sterile replacement with no character and no continuation of civic memory there are a number of emotional moments filmed during the younger kahn's journey including with his halfsisters and his mother but they're genuine and moving not maudlin and staged historians of architecture will always study kahn his son found reasons to remember him as a flawed but very iconoclastic and ultimately private man,0.4346309304237366,36,0.9563532763532764,Y,0.05

catchphrases  rangi ram used to say to his punkah wallah don't be such clever dickie and he ended a lot of the shows saying here is a very old hindu proverb e g when wife is having affair with best

graham  he would always sarcastically talk in a posh accent this show doesn't enjoy the same recognition as dads army did  this is probably due to a question of taste  this is seen as being crude  williams is homophobic calling his men puffs though it has to be said williams is a bore  also  some people think there is a racial element in the humour  using the fact that michael bates was blacked up to play rangi ram bates was actually born in india though and spoke urdu before he spoke english  so the bbc will feel a bit uneasy putting it on  even though the vast majority of people who have

1,if it is true that sadomasochism is a twosided coin which contains the whole in the diverse expression of its opposites  then the cinematic portrait of erika kohut has its reality  professor kohut treats her piano students with a kind of fascist sadism while longing for the same for herself  her outward expression projects her desire  that is why she can hurt without guilt or remorse along comes talented  charming  handsome young walter klemmer benoit magimel who is attracted to her because of her passion and her intensity  he wants to become her student so as to be close to her  she rejects him out of hand  but because of his talent the vienna conservatory votes him in  he falls in love with her  again she pushes him away  but he will not take no for an answer  and thereby begins his own descent into depravity and loss of selfrespect the question the viewer might ask at this point is  who is in control  the sadist or the masochist  indeed who is the sadist and who the masochist  it is hard to tell  is it the person who has just been greatly abused both psychologically and physically  who is actually lying wounded on the floor in grotesque triumphant and fulfillment  or is it the person who is rushing out the door  sated  giving the order that no one is to know what happened but erika is not just a sadomasochistic freak  she is a sex extreme freak  she wants to experience the extremes of human sexuality while maintaining the facade of respectability  actually that isn't even true  she says she doesn't care what others think  she doesn't care if they walk in and find her bleeding on the floor because she is in love  love  she calls it  for her sex and love are one and the same at one point walter tells her that love isn't everything  how ironic such a superfluity is to her  how gratuitous the comment the movie is beautifully cut and masterfully directed by michael haneke who spins the tale with expert camera work and carefully constructed sets in which the essence of the action is not just clear but exemplified as in the bathroom when walter propels himself high above the top of the stall to find erika within  he also employs a fine positioning of the players so that they are always where they should be with well timed cuts from one angle to another  this is particularly important in the scene in which erika  like a blooddrained corpse caught in stark white and black light  lies under her lover  rigid as stone  here for the most part we only see her face and the stark outline of her neck with its pulsating artery  we don't need to see any more the part of erika kohut is perfect for isabelle huppert who is not afraid of extremes  indeed she excels in them  i have seen her in a number of movies and what she does better than almost anyone is become the character body and soul  like the woman she plays in this movie she is unafraid of what others may think and cares little about her appearance in a decorative sense  what matters to her is the performance and the challenge  no part is too demanding  no character too depraved  it's as if huppert wants to experience all of humanity  and wants us to watch her as she does  she is always fascinating and nearly flawless  she is not merely a leading light of the french cinema  she is one of the great actresses of our time who has put together an amazingly diverse body of work i think it is highly instructive and affords us a wonderful and striking contrast to compare her performance here with her performance in the lacemaker la dentellière from when she was years old  there she was apple sweet in her red hair and freckles and her pretty face and her cute little figure playing pomme  a parisian apprentice hairdresser  her character was shy about sex and modestjust an ordinary french girl who hoped one day to be a beautician  here she is a selfdestructive witch  bitter with hateful knowledge of herself  shameless and entirely depraved huppert is fortunate in being an actress in france where there are parts like this for women past the age of starlets  hollywood could never make a movie like this  in the american cinema  only a handful of the very best and hardest working actresses can hope to have a career after the age of about thirty  huppert greatly increases her exposure because of her ability and range  but also because she is willing to play unsympathetic roles  here and also in la cérémonie  in which she plays a vile  spiteful murderess do see this for isabelle huppert  you won't forget her or the character she brings to

0,first of all  the nature in the movie is beautiful  and there is a bit of mongolian music  well  the horses looked mongolian and the camels  but that's about all what was mongolian in it  oh  borte is played by a mongolian actress  albeit a lame performance  but she is pretty  which redeems a bit the lack of performance on her part but  i totally failed to understand what was the point of this painfulto watch piece of hour fantasy created by mr bodrov  the plot totally lacked any sense of cohesion  there was no logic behind the development of the plot  in fact  there was hardly any story at all  just a number of loosely tied scenes with a bunch of guys in mongolian clothes  speaking some kinda pidgin that is supposed to sound like mongolian  most actors were either japanese  russian or chinese  most scenes were shot in china  kazakhstan or russia and there were a lot of disturbing pathos about what is it to be a mongolian the dialog is primitive and the scenes with dialog are slow  the battle scenes are laughable  all the supernatural pathos is lame and is obviously there only to make up for the lack of the story the japanese actor was like a wooden doll  and looking at him one wouldn't get any idea how this person could become a leader who could unite the nomadic tribes  he looked sleepy  soft  stiff and pitiful for the most part of the movie and i don't even want to start on the subject of the historical relevance of this piece of cinematic waste  to see chinggiskhan half of the movie as a slave  to see his two first kids be born from other men  to see his wife selling herself to the tangut merchant  my blood starts to boil  and where is the beautiful story about the friendship between temujin and jamukha  one could make a great movie out of it  where is the story of the rise of temujin  of his childhood  of his relationship with his family  with his brothers  of how he struggled to survive among mighty enemies of his family  where is van khan  who helped him a lot  where is the depiction of life in the steppe  of the life of the nomads  of their traditions  of their relations with the other nations around them where is development of the characters  we totally fail to see what brought temujin together with jamukha and what brought them apart and most important  how temujin became chinggiskhan  how he  an outcast with no wealth and military power managed to unite the mongolian tribes and create such an organized and effective war machine that crushed one nation after another and created the largest land empire in history  all this could make

all i got at the end of it was a £ coaster  absolutely awful  i don't even know where to begin  i have no idea why anyone has given this more than stars because i can't think of one good thing to say about it  the plot is basically  people go into an unexplored cave  one of them is a reporter  noone else knows they are there  when they get in the cave  they can't get out and they get killed off one by one by a monster  there turns out to be no reason for the reporter  one of the characters has some past demons where his ex girlfriend drowns in a cave years ago  there seems to be no relevance or reason for that either  just a rubbish attempt at character building i assume  anyway  the monster turns out to be a guy that wandered into the cave as a normal little kid and has lived in there all his life  this for no reason makes him superhuman  able to glow  see in the dark  take bullets  breathe underwater  be in places at once and have insane strength able to move boulders  carry grown men as dead weight  etc  in the end scene there are women left alive  they wake up naked  just covered in some bit of rug or something  they then find a picture of a kid  the monster then bursts in the door  wrapped in a carpet with some sort of animal skull over his head says in the directors commentary it was a crow's skull  if so that would be the frekin biggest crow i have seen in my life and quite literally goes raaah  like a kiddie on halloween  i was watching it with my boyfriend and at that point he literally burst out laughing  the guy then sees a picture of himself as a kid and has a flashback to him sitting under a tree with his face all burnt and then getting up and wandering into the cave  that is the extent of the back story to why he mutilates people and it leaves you feeling a bit cheated for a story  the monster then kills one of the women and brutally rapes the other one  cut to end credits  i know the rape scene was designed to be shocking  but as a woman it just made me feel quite ill and was the thing that affected me the most in the whole film  he could have killed her and cut her into pieces and ate her and it would have been less horrific than the rape scene there are so many things that are left unanswered at the end  aside from all this  the scenes where there was minutes at a time of just black and nothing else was annoying and the constant nauseating camera angles where it's all upside down and you can't see what's going on wound me up so much at one point i almost turned it off  an absolutely terrible film  you might as well get the

1,if vampire tales are your cup of blood  then this gothfest based on the anne rice vampire chronicles should prove to be a satisfying experience  a veritable consortium of the undead in a

townsend  bored with a world that no longer excites him  has been asleep' for many years  but suddenly  the sounds of that world he hears from his extended slumber change  and liking what he hears  he ventures forth to investigate  what he finds is a world filled with new sounds  a new kind of music driving and penetrating sounds that assault the senses and make him feel alive and welcome  and he knows that at long last his time has come  that it is time for him and those like him to come out into the open and face the world on their terms  toward that end he becomes the front man for a band a singer and performer unlike any the world has ever known  he presents himself as a vampire  and very quickly amasses a following that extends far beyond london where it all begins  and will ultimately take him to death valley  california  where he plans to give a concert that promises to be beyond anything anyone has ever seen or experienced  lestat is powerful  without question  but there are those of his kind who do not take favorably to the fact that he has revealed them  one of whom is marius vincent perez  a vampire powerful in his own right the vampire  in fact  who made' lestat so many years before and they are gathering  coming together and making their plans to meet lestat at the concert  and they are not going for the music  but there is something else  as well  at one point

chosen to rule by her side as her king  lestat  and at the concert  rest assured  akasha will be in attendance  without fail  make no mistake  this is lestat's story  and rymer presents it amid a setting rich with atmosphere and with some exquisite moments  though his film has less bite to it than say  interview with the vampire ' or bram stoker's dracula ' he sets a good pace  and there are some scenes that provide some real thrills  but overall the film isn't as soaked in menace as it could be  or as much as one might expect  in the final tally  in fact  the amount of flesh that is incinerated wins out over actual bloodletting  though there is more than a taste of gore  and more than a fair share of lips and mouths dripping with the red stuff  there's some good f  x on hand  too  especially in the sequences that accentuate the speed of the vampires  as they move and hurtle through the air faster than the naked eye can discern  it's a decent job by rymer  but he could have put more teeth into it had he played up the alienation hinted at by lestat  as it is  you get a sense of his detachment  but not enough to get you totally involved  in interview with the vampire ' tom cruise brought some charismatic star power to the role of lestat  but townsend is even more effective  with a look and an attitude that captures lestat perfectly  he plays him with a sense of acceptance  and under closer scrutiny you may even find a hint of remorse and longing  it's a good performance  and one that sells his character convincingly  as marius  vincent perez does a nice job  too he is  in fact  one of the strengths of the film though his character is a bit ambiguous  that  however  has more to do with the way he was written than with perez's performance  which is quite good  turning in noteworthy performances  as well  are marguerite moreau  as jesse  a young woman too curious for her own goo and the gorgeous lena olin as maharet  jesse's aunt  who ultimately plays a pivotal role in the outcome of the drama involving lestat and akasha  and as akasha  aaliyah is an absolutely riveting presence  what more can one say about her other than she is a gifted performer  with tremendous talent and beauty  and  tragically  she has left us much too soon  the supporting cast includes paul mcgann  david   christian manon  mael   claudia black  pandora   bruce spence

0,where do i begin  its one of the most frustrating movies i've seen because it makes a lot of sense in terms of the point but it comes off as seriously stupid  a movie about a ghost inhabited bed  the first minutes of the movie shows a black and white flashback of a weird looking fat dude going dominatrix on a fabienne from pulp fiction lookalike contest winner and strangles her with his tie  this is supposed to set up how the bed factors into the story  still though  if you wanted an opening to keep people interested or send them away early  having a strangulation is the way to do it  fast forward to the present day  a married couple moves into an apartment with a friendly landlord and begins unpacking their things  so far everything's normal  then one night while doing the hippity dippity on a single mattress  they realize they need a bed frame  this is where things get fishy  why didn't they bring or buy a gd damn bed frame before they got there  we learn that the door leading to the attic where the first minutes took place doesn't open but then once the couple realizes they need a bed frame  the door magically opens  they go up to the attic and discover the old bed frame and decide to bring it downstairs and their lovemaking days are saved  or so they thought  the rest of the movie centers around the both of them being haunted by the bedframe  the female is an artist so she starts drawing up the ghoulish images she dreams about and the male is a photographer so he starts having his models act as if they're bring tortured or tied up one of which has gray hair and appears over years old  yuck the female grows increasingly scared and she discovers the house she lives in was once a haven for serial killings and murders which bring about the end to the movie  they find the friendly landlord murdered which makes no sense since ghosts need to take a human form to kill and decide to get the hell out of dodge  while packing up  the husband moronically goes up into the attic where he is possessed by the crazy fat dude and the female bashes his skull in before the cops show up and take her to a mental ward where she kills some dude trying to hit on her well if you've read this far you have to be thinking one thing  why the hell didn't they just throw the bedframe out the window  seriously  they never said anything about the actual house being haunted  just

point but it comes off as seriously daft a movie about a specter inhabited cot the first minutes of the movie shows a black and bianca flashback of a weird search fat dude going dominatrix on a fabienne from pulp fiction lookalike contest winner and strangles her with his tie this is supposed to set up how the bed factors into the story still although if you wanted an opening to keeping citizens interested or send them away early having a strangulation is the manner to do it fast forward to the present day a married couple moves into an apartment with a cordial landlord and begins unpacking their things so greatly everything's normal then one night while doing the hippity dippity on a single cushions they realize they needs a sleeper frame this is where facets get fishy why didn't they bring or buy a gd damn bed frame before they got there we learn that the door leading to the attic where the first mn took place doesn't open but then once the couple realizes they need a bed frame the door magically opens they go up to the attic and discover the old bed frame and decide to bring it basement and their lovemaking days are rescued or so they thought the rest of the movie centers around the both of them being haunted by the bedframe the female is an performers so she starts attracting up the grim images she dreams about and the male is a photographer so he starts having his models act as if they're bring tortures or tied up one of which has gray hair and appears over years old yuck the female grows increasingly scared and she discovers the house she lives in was once a haven for serial killings and murders which bring about the end to the movie they find the friendly landlord murdered which makes no sense since ghosts need to take a human form to kill and decide to get the hell out of dodge while packing up the husband moronically goes up into the attic where he is possessed by the crazy fat dude and the female bashes his skull in before the cops show up and take her to a mental ward where she kills some dude trying to hit on her well if you've read this far you have to be thinking one thing why the hell didn't they just throw the bedframe out the window seriously they never said anything about the actual house being haunted just the bed so why not get rid of the damn thing and move on that's why the movie is so frustrating because it actually is a good plot and the actors follow suit accordingly but there are more holes in it than sonny corleone at a toll booth the couple did try to leave town as upposed to every other movie that has the

1,i have looked into the eye of this island  and what i saw was beautiful  proclaims one of the main characters in abc's award winning television show lost the series could be summarized as a drama story about a group of plane crash survivors stranded on an unknown island  but that would be doing the show a disservice  lost follows a large group of characters who come into conflict with the island  each other  and ultimately themselves as they struggle with their new way of life and their dependency on each other  the situation becomes more complicated when it becomes clear this isn't an ordinary island  either  and that they may not be alone my initial fear after hearing the concept of this series was the lack of new stories they could tell us after a certain period  but this proved to be unfounded  the narrative flows naturally  the dialogue is witty  the characters are memorable and the execution is superb  the island is a character all on its own  and to understand this comment you'd have to see the series for yourself  which only goes to show its originality and greatness at the time of writing this review  only the first two seasons have aired  and they're filled with strong episodes  my only mild criticism is that the second season seems to slow down a bit halfway  but then fortunately comes back in admirable shape for the final episodes if i can recommend one television series you should be following right now  it would certainly be this one  if you like excitement  adventure  character driven stories  an extremely strong cast and crew  beautiful locations  and an island that seems more spiritual than natural  lost is for you  just be sure you start at the beginning ,0.992171049118042,0,i have looked into the eye of this island and what i saw was beautiful declare somebody of the main character in abc's award winning television show lost the series could be recap as a drama story about a group of plane crash survivors stranded on an unnamed island but that would be doing the show a disservice lost follows a large panels of characters who come into conflict with the island each other and ultimately themselves as they struggle with their novel routes of life and their dependency on each other the situation becomes more convoluted when it becomes clear this isn't an ordinary island nor and that they may not be alone my initial fear after hearing the concept of this series was the lacking of new stories they could tell us after a certain period but this proved to be unfounded the narrative flows naturally the dialogue is witty the nature are noteworthy and the execution is magnificent the island is a personage all on its own and to understand this comment you'd have to see the series for yourself which only goes to show its originality and greatness at the time of writing this review only the firstly two spells have aired and they're populate with strong episodes my only mild criticism is that the second season seems to slow down a bit halfway but then fortunately comes revert in admirable form for the final episodes if i can recommend one television series you should be following right now it would certainly be this somebody if you like excitement fling personage driven stories an extremely strong thrown and crewmen beautiful locations and an peninsula that seem more spiritual than natural lost is for you just be sure you start at the beginning,0.4502823948860169,27,0.9273907910271548,Y,0.09
1,this comment does contain spoilers  there are few actors that have an intangible to them  that innate quality which is an amalgamation of charisma  panache and swagger  it's the quality that can separate good actors from the truly great  i think george clooney has it and so does jack nicholson  you can look at clooney's subtle touches in scenes like his one word goodbye to andy garcia in ocean's when they just utter each other's name disdainfully  terry  danny  you can pick any number of jack's performances dating as far back as five easy pieces in the diner to a few good men and his court room interrogation scene  these guys just have it  you can add denzel washington to the small and exclusive list of actors who exudes that terrific trait in everything he does  if you look at some of his explosive borderline diatribes in the siege to his impressive tribute to malcolm x in spike lee's film of the same name  you can see that there is no finer an actor working today  i don't mention all of this to insinuate that man on fire is perfect just because of denzel's work  but he is definitely the cog of the production  i was literally mesmerized with some of his scenes that are raw  emotional and incendiary all at the same time washington plays creasy a former spy or cia agent or one of those covert government operatives  he has pretty much hit rock bottom as he has become disillusioned with the life that he has led  he has killed and perhaps done things that are best left unsaid and this has made him a hardened and bitter man  his friend and perhaps mentor  played very reservedly by christopher walken  is living in mexico making a very comfortable living by providing body guard services for the rich  apparently the kidnapping business in mexico is so vibrant that these paid former s e a l s and such can do very well while providing a needed service  creasey needs the work and accepts a job with a well to do family who seems to be in some financial difficulty  marc anthony is fine as samuel  radha mitchell is tantalizingly sexy as his wife lisa and dakota fanning is just unbelievably and precociously brilliant as pita  i don't know how a child of her age can have such range to play the characters that she does but her interpretation of pita is nothing short of oscar worthy  the film's entire first half is dependent on the relationship between pita and creasy and if there was a weaker actress in the role  perhaps that emotional synergy would not have come across so succinctly  but fanning is nothing short of remarkable in the role it is the relationship between pita and creasy that drives this film to the apex of cinema  together they are perfect and there is a real bond developed between them  tony scott directs with a frenetic urgency and his eye for visual flare has never been better  i am interested to see how his next film  domino  turns out  i think scott is one of today's under rated directors and with more films like this one  his name will surely be elevated to icon status the story has creasy really taking to pita  and visca versa  there is a definite connection between the two of them and perhaps it stems from the fact that although pita loves her dad  he is not around much  he is a philanthropist and obviously has little time to spend with his family  soon  creasy is taking pita to her swimming competition  he is reading her bedtime stories and she is naming her teddy bear creasy it's not just a friendship between them  it is more of a kinship  and a deep parental love seems to be present  the film changes gears when pita does get kidnapped and held for ransom and creasy is is almost fatally injured trying to protect her  this is where the story becomes thick with innuendo and ripe with deceit as the plot pieces get unraveled like an onion  and this is where denzel becomes a tour de force  like i said earlier  i have seen denzel give some outstanding performances in films like crimson tide and training day  but never have i seen him like this  he is a man possessed and with the possibility of pita being dead  he becomes a literal man on fire  it rages in him as he hunts down and dishes out his brand of comeuppance  denzel's anger and acerbity are ubiquitous and not easily quelled as he hunts down each person responsible for pita's violation  this all vigilante justice as the mexican authorities always seem to be one step behind  also what is paramount to this film's audacious brilliance is that there are few films that actually give the criminals their due comeuppance  i have often been frustrated to watch films where the bad guys get let off easily  they inflict all kinds of torment for the entire film and then they take a bullet and die  but not in this film  writer brian helgeland sees to it that retribution here is unequivocal and it is painful  the perpetrators here feel creasy's wrath and they experience the torment that he unleashes  there is nothing gimmicky about his brand of justice  he needs information and someone loses a finger  he wants answers and a homemade bomb is placed in places that are meant for other things  there is no punches pulled here and this is one of the true strengths of the film man on fire is one the five best films of now that it is out on dvd  my recommendation is to get the se  it is loaded with bonus features that include about hours of documentaries and different commentary tracks   ,0.9910146594047546,0,this comment does including vandals there are few actors that have an intangible to them that integral

be in there and jumps straight at the camera while shrieking then they happen to notice there is a hole in the wall  so let's stick our hand in  wow  they pulled out a doll of a baby wrapped in mummy tape let's go to the attic  uhoh it feels 'heavy' up here  boom  a chair flies across the room time to eat  oh no  the girl that was scared of bugs had a roach in her sandwich  lol  ridiculous let's get out the ouija board  oops one of the legs on the planchette fell off the side of the board  that couldn't be because the people were pushing it could it  they find out a ghost there is named charles wait  what was that noise in the chimney  clink  oh my shackles fell out i think she kept people up here now wimpy girl is going to brave looking up the chimney shaft  oh  what's this she sees something  and is asking people who aren't looking up the chimney what it is  swish  it falls off straight at her  perfect camera shot she moves just in time  it was more chain now we have to separate and each 'cleanse' our designated rooms  wouldn't it be something if things started happening one by one to these people now  okay chick  wow  suddenly her room is shaking  but no one elses does dude  actually says to himself charles  is that you charles  it can't be you because you're just a figment of my imagination aren't you charles well guess what  he gets knocked over and dragged across the floor  another lucky camera shot chick  hears things  try to communicate  and is standing there getting abrasions or something dude  he was in the attic  reached his arm through a hole in the floor and got a splinter  i don't remember what else dude  runs  gets chick hear chick and dude  screaming  they find them chained to a wall and strapped to a table  they leave  cut to black  final text

promotional talk  additionally there is a good music video tag team table match  bubby ray and spike dudley vs  eddie guerro and chris benoit  this was a pretty good intense match to start off the

quick though  wwe european championship  jeff hardy v  william regal  i've never really liked regal as a wrestler  he lacks intensity and style  hardy was impressive but really didn't get a chance to show off his high flying act  although he still performed some good counters and added that needed fast pace to the match  it ended off quickly which was perfect for this match  john cena v  chris jericho  it's funny looking back at cena's very first ppv  how he used to act  how he used to dress  and how he used to look watch his interview  it's pretty funny  this was a good intense match with cena showing a nice variety of holds  suplexes  counters and some aerial  jericho was subpar but definitely helped cena launch his career  cena wins wwe intercontenital championship  rvd v  brock lesnar this was a very intense and good match  both wrestlers styles really matched up well on the screen  with brocks pure power and raw energy vs  rvds skill full moves and quickness  rvd looked great in this match better than his later matches with edge and cenaand the entire match was fast pace  the ending worked perfectly because it still preserved brock's undefeated streak while giving rvd his just desserts in his home state no disqualification match  booker t v  big show  another solid match that lacked a certain intensity as the rvd match but still a good follow up  although it started off kinda slow which it always is with big show booker t was impressive and did a sick move on the announcers table  the finisher was awesome  the ending was a great upset and big move up for booker t wwe tag team championship  hogan and edge v  christian and lance storm  this was a mediocre match  hogan comes out like usual to a huge pop but his variety of moves lacks that intensity and energy  then again christian doesn't exactly have the greatest athletic abilities himself  this ended up being a mediocre match at best but was still ok for ppv  triple threat match for the undisputed

released  and edward carnby  slater  has some link to them thanks to some operation given to children in his orphanage which has failed on him  he finds an artefact involving the demons and brings it to an exgirlfriend anthropologist  reid   who of course he manages to have sex with right away for no good reason  then  out of nowhere  all hell breaks loose  and the pair end up with a military team led by some asshole commander  dorff   who apparently has a mutual hatred for carnby it's all ridiculous  and the reason i don't really understand it isn't just because it's complicated and jumbled  but it leaves no room for anyone to really care  instead  i highly recommend that  if you must see this film  bring a tennis ball or something to occupy yourself when the plot manages to bore you into confusion the action scenes in a movie with a plot as terrible as this should at least bring it up a little  right  too bad  this movie is like any other ruined crap ever made  with enough quick cuts to behead a coop of chickens  considering that this is based on a horror game  not an action game  it is especially annoying the first action scene involving a man chasing cranby from a taxi is among the worst i have ever had to witness  and the rest isn't all that great either  the demons look somewhat cool  though the fact that they turn into powder when killed takes away all that effect  scenes involving lots of guns which should be cool to watch instead involve the muzzle fire as the only source of light and the camera zooming and panning faster than the head of a crack addict  it's all the kind of seizure inducing crap that keeps children in bed at night the acting is what i like to call taking actors and making them do nothing  slater does nothing but sound important for the whole movie  though he does seem to have more talent than he is letting on  the same is true of dorff  who gets a thankless role despite actually having some talent something that has happened to him a lot  reid is pretty much exactly what she should be  background sex appeal  as whenever she tries to act it is a disaster as is the incredibly bad scientist look she has in the beginning in all  this is the type of movie that worries me about future video game movies  if they keep ruining the spirit like this  it's only a matter of time before samus aran is killing middleeasterns with an ak and tommy

1,lately i have been watching a lot of tom hanks films and old chaplin films and even some of rowan atkinson's early bean performances  and it seems that all of them have their own unique charm that permeates throughout their work  something that allows them to identify with audience members of all ages  in a way that just makes you feel good  a bug's life has that same charm  it has a connection with real life that allows us to easily suspend disbelief and accept a lot of talking insects  because even though they talk  they still act just like real bugs  it's like the team that made the movie found a way to bring us into the mind of a child and allow us to think like them  to imagine bugs the way a young mind does honey  i shrunk the kids was one of my favorite films when i was younger  and to me  a bug's life is like a more realistic version of that movie  if only because the animation is so breathtaking and this style of storytelling just opens up so many more narrative possibilities  i try not to compare it to something like toy story which i still maintain is the best computer animated film ever made  because the story of a bug's life is not quite as good as toy story's  but then again  almost nothing is  the important thing is that it is still wonderful fun  the story concerns a colony of hard working bugs who have an impressively developed society  mostly geared around building a harvest of food  most of which will go to the tyrannical grasshoppers  vastly superior in strength and general meanness  and hopefully still leave enough left over for the bugs to make it through the winter  we are treated to some visits from the grasshoppers  who make it clear that if the bugs provide an unsatisfactory quantity of food  the consequences will be dire  and incidentally  the similarities between this crippling level of food extraction is strikingly similar to mao tsetung's vicious forcing of food from his own people during the great leap forward the fun and excitement begins when flik  the main character  sets off on a quest to find a gang of appropriate warrior bugs to come back and help defend the colony against the grasshoppers  you see  he spilled all of the amassed food and placed everyone in great danger  so he feels it's his responsibility  but he inadvertently ends up hiring a struggling group of insect circus performers  great for the audience  not so great for the safety of the clan  the movie was released back in the late s  when so many films seemed to have been coming out in twos  like armageddon and deep impact  independence day and the arrival  a bug's life and antz  etc  comparisons between a bug's life and antz are inevitable  although it seems clear to me that a bug's life is by far the superior film  and not only because it doesn't star woody allen stuttering and whining through the lead role  this is great family fun ,0.9934870004653932,0,lately i have been watching a parcel of tum cusack movie and antique chaplin films and even some of rowan atkinson's prematurely bean interpretations and it seems that all of them have their own sole charm that enters throughout their collaborating nada that enabled them to identify with audience deputies of all ages in a way that just makes you feel alright a bug's vida has that same charm it has a connection with real life that allows americans to easily halt disbelief and accept a lot of talking insects because even though they talk they still act just like real bugs it's like the team that made the movie found a way to bring us into the intelligence of a child and allow us to think like them to imagine bugs the way a young mind does honey i shrunk the kids was one of my favorite films when i was younger and to me a bug's vie is like

there for exposition  get around to telling us what is going on or whatever  there's little point to care  the filmmaking is shoddy i e  the degree rule is broken many times over and not in a

to be the climax  it takes so long  and is just constant chaos  it's the portion of the film that moves from individual characters and nice tight knit shots  to fiery explosions from each direction and violence happening to characters we don't know or care about overall  this movie is amazing to look at  it's a well done horror film  but even with that said  it has the occasional failure in

0,you know  i really have a problem with movie lists  i was reading maxim magazine a while ago and they had a list of the greatest bmovies of all time  and knowing me  i of course have to go through and watch them all and write reviews of all of them  this is why you see reviews of movies like gator bait and barb wire and coffy on my list  so i noticed h o t s  at the video store the other day and recognized it from maxim's list of the greatest bmovies  and i decided to rent it and check it out  my only consolation is that i rented it because i recognized it from a list of bmovies  so i already knew it was going to suck  given the type of movie that it is  i can't say that h o t s  is a total failure  since it is nothing more than a late s t film  and it never pretends to by anything else  the only place where it strays widely from its objective is in a ragged subplot involving a couple of excons who have stashed a lot of stolen money in the house that the selfnamed h o t s  move in to  because this subplot has absolutely no place in the movie  despite the fact that the rest of the movie is as well  this subplot is completely superfluous and unnecessary  the story is based on a couple of rival sororities at the beloved f u  which exists as one of those universities that contains a grand total of one sorority until the rejects form their own in order to get back at the snobs in the other one  this new sorority  help out the seals h o t s   is a sorority supposedly based on helping seals the seal subplot is another one that doesn't really belong in the movie  and little attention is paid to the meaning of that name beyond having a seal running around here and there throughout the movie  this is going to sound weird  but there was actually one scene that i was pretty impressed with in this movie  one shot that i was impressed with  i should say  about midway through the movie  one of the girls in pi  the rival sorority  is pouring alcohol into the punch  and she pours some for herself in a glass and drinks it  oddly enough  what she does as she drinks that alcohol reminds me of something that charlie chaplin would do  which really brightened up the movie  obviously  nothing in this movie comes close to anything that chaplin ever did  but that shot alone raised my score for the movie from a to a as a whole  however  the movie is exactly what you would expect it to be  a lot of people running around looking for excuses to take off their clothes i liked how the removeonepieceofclothingforeveryscore in the football game at the end was one of the girls' ideas  riiiiiiiiight   and not much thought is put into much of anything else  there is  for example  a scene early in the film when a couple of the pi girls pour hot sauce into the refreshments at a h o t s  party  accidentally getting caught in an incriminating photograph the girl taking the picture didn't realize that she photographed them at the time  although the photograph never comes up for any reason later in the film  i've seen movies like this before  it's kind of like gator bait but without the violence and the rednecks and coffy wasn't far off  even barb wire is much the same  just with a bigger budget and more silicon  thankfully  maxim's bmovie list contains only a few more comedies  because while these cheesy teen t films are entertaining every once in a

1,daisy movie review by james mudge from beyondhollywood comon paper  daisy sounds like an asian film fan's dream come true  directed by infernal affairs cohelmer andrew lau and starring everybody's favourite sassy girl  popular korean actress jeon ji hyun  unfortunately  despite the talent involved  and the fact that the crew flew halfway around the world to shoot in amsterdam  the film turns out to be a bit of a disappointment  being a clich'd romantic drama which wallows in misery and self importance the plot follows hye young jeon ji hyun  a rather naive korean girl who lives in amsterdam  spending her life working in her grandfather's antique shop and doing portraits for tourists  one day  she begins receiving flowers at exactly the same time from a secret admirer  who she believes to be a mystery man from her past who once built her a nice little bridge  one day she meets jeong woo lee seong jae  also in holiday and public enemy  who unbeknownst to her is actually an interpol agent tracking asian criminals in the netherlands with hye young assuming that jeong woo is responsible for the flowers  the two fall very slowly into a chaste romantic relationship  however  it turns out that the man sending the flowers is actually park yi jung woo sung  from sad movie and musa  an assassin working for a chinese crime syndicate  inevitably  the love triangle turns tragic and the two men end up facing off while poor hye young tries to work out which of the two is the love of her life although daisy is ostensibly a love story  it has the feel of a funeral  with a slow  sombre pace and a plot which piles on the misery  half of the film's running time is taken up with scenes of the characters staring longingly out of windows into the rain  with the silence broken only by bouts of self pitying narration  director lau seems to be under the impression that the film is a weighty shakespearean tragedy  rather than yet another gloomy hitman love story  as such  the proceedings have a rather pretentious air  despite the fact that the plot is inherently predictable and based largely around glaring cliché borrowed liberally from the likes of fulltime killer and john woo's classic the killeralmost every aspect of the film is riddled with angst  with the three lead characters suffering as if the weight of the world was on their shoulders  and steadfastly refusing to do anything to pursue their romantic inclinations  park yi in particular  as the kind of overly emotional  socially retarded assassin so beloved of modern cinema  is faintly ludicrous  from his blatant incompetence on the job to his hilarious attempts to discuss impressionist painting with hye young or his penchant for flower growing  this languid passivity does make the film's central romance somewhat hard to swallow  and lau's attempts to evoke the feeling that it is fate which brings the characters together comes across more as shoddy coincidence fans of jeon ji hyun should note that her character is far closer to her role in the glum supernatural drama the uninvited than my sassy girl or windstruck and while she tries her best to pull a few wacky faces here and there  her performance is certainly more subdued the film benefits from glossy production values  and lau makes good use of the amsterdam scenery  playing on the contrast between the grey  almost gothic beauty of the city and the innocent blue skies and flowery fields of the countryside  unfortunately  he tends to overuse slow motion for some of the emotional scenes  which when coupled with some of the picture postcard visuals gives the film the feel at times of a perfume advert  there are a few scenes of surprisingly violent action  though these are few and far between  and whilst well staged  seem to have been thrown in as an afterthought and do little more than briefly raising the pulse despite its flaws  daisy makes for engaging viewing  and the story grips almost in spite of itself  mainly out of a morbid fascination to see not which of the men hye young will end up with  but to see who will lie dying in her arms  the self indulgent melodrama works well enough to tick all the right boxes for the genre  and the film functions perfectly well as an enjoyably glossy  weepy romance it is worth noting that the dvd features the director's cut of the film  which for once indicates that it is substantially different from the theatrical version  which not only adds minutes  but reorders some of the scenes  making the narrative less linear  although this new version is perhaps too long  it is surely superior  as without these changes  the film would surely have been even more conventional and would have suffered from even murkier character development wai keung lau

a few goosebumps during the kareenasaif love story kareena in the rain  behind me on my bike hm  but mostly this half promises more than it delivers  which makes the second half all the more

enough to merit being in the bottom films ever made list  i have personally seen at least films worse than this one  hardly a glowing endorsement  but it just didn't meet the expected level of awfulness to be included on this infamous list the film begin with stewart moss and marianne mcandrew on their belated honeymoon by the way  they are married in real life as well  he's a doctor who is obsessed with bats and insists they go to a nearby cave  once there  they behave very  very  very stupidly hallmark of a bad film and are soon bitten by a bat  according to this film  bats love to attack people and there are vampire bats in the usboth of which are not true at all oddly  after being bitten  the man doesn't even bother going to the hospital  the first thing on anyone's mind especially a doctor is to get medical help immediately  but not this boob  soon  he's having seizuresyet he still isn't interested in seeking help  again and again you keep thinking that this must be the stupidest couple in film history  after a while  he eventually goes to see a doctor and is sent to the hospital  but  by then it's too late and his attacks become more violent and he begins killing people to suck their blood  when it's totally obvious to everyone that the man is a crazed killing machine  the wife who  like her husband  has a grapefruit for a brain refuses to believe he's dangerouseven after he attacks people  steals an ambulance and runs a police car off the road  now most of the time moss is going through these episodes  his eyes roll back and he looks like a normal person  oddly  however  a couple times he develops batlike hands and towards the end they used some nice prosthetics on him to make him look quite batlike  had this been really cheesy  the film would have merited a in the very end  in a twist that hardly made any sense at all  the wife inexplicably turned into a crazed bat lady and had a swarm of bats kill the evil sheriff  how all this was arranged was a mystery as was moss' and mcandrew's belief that this film would somehow help their careersthough they both have had reasonably long careers on tv playing bit roles since overall  very dumb  the plot is silly and makes no sense and strongly relies on people acting way too dumb to be real  not a good film at all  but not among the worst films of all time either note  for some reason

also made many of their best stories into great western drama like any show that was shooting over thirty episodes every season  there are bound to be some weak ones  however  most of the time each episode had an interesting story  some kind of conflict  and a resolution that usually did not include violence  while bonanza was a western  the gunfighting was never featured as the main attraction  while i am a fan of the rifleman and wante dead or alive  those shows usually ended with a gunfight  gunfights were how many westerns resolved every conflict  and bonanza was very different in trying to seek peaceful resolutions and harmony instead of killing in the early years of bonanza  there are some interesting episodes that do feature a lot of gunfights  those episodes stand in contrast to the rest of the series  but they are pretty good in and of themselves  in when pernell whitaker wanted to leave the show  guy williams was brought in to replace him  williams was playing the role of a longlost cousin  unfortunately  whitaker decided to stay one more year  and thus williams was written out of the series when he moved away to marry adam's old girlfriend  if williams had stayed on for the duration of bonanza  one can only wonder how much better the series would have been in the years after when pernell whitaker left the show undoubtedly  once pernell whitaker left the series  the stories focused more on comedy and country hijinks  whitaker had often played the heavy in many episodes  and his absence left a void in the cast  little joe always wanted to play the nice kid  and hoss always wanted to play the good old boy with a heart of gold  since ben was the kind and wise patriarch of the family  that did not leave too much room for any gunfights at some point they hired a ranch hand called candy david canary who became their fourth member of the cast  but candy was never featured in any gunfights  and he was hardly more than an older version of little joe  for a year or two they also had ben take in some other lost cousin jamie  played by the forgettable mitch vogel who was a teenager that was usually getting into some kind of trouble with someone apparently by adding the teenager  the studio was looking to attract younger viewers  it also gave the writers a chance to write episodes about teenage problems  alcohol  delinquency  etc  those kind of preachy episodes were popular in the s as a reaction of the establishment media to the counterculture movement  dragnet was probably the most popular source of law and order tv  though hawaii the f b i  and many other shows also tried to jump on the bandwagon by doing tv shows that featured irresponsible teenagers causing mischief  mayhem  and crime the addition of a teenager to the cast gave the cartwrights more chances to show up and solve problems  but those episodes feel very contrived and are not very good in general  after dan blocker died  the series limped along for another year or so before it was canceled  the last season was pretty bad  as it featured little joe tracking down the killers of his wife  and most of the episodes were somewhat depressing because little joe was usually drinking or otherwise remembering how much he loved his wife  and how unfair it was that she was killed i don't think i have ever seen the last episode of the series  and i wonder if they ever officially wrapped it up in some way  by the last year  there was only ben lorne greene actually living on the ponderosa  as adam had moved away and never came back even once as a guest and hoss had died and little joe had left after his wife in the series had been killed by drifters overall  the era from is the best of this series  once adam left  it slowly declined  most of the shows before are

0,is there any other time period that has been so exhaustively covered by television or the media in general as the s  no  and do we really need yet another trip through that turbulent time  not really  but if we must have one  does it have to be as shallow as the 's i like to think that cowriters bill couturie and robert greenfield had more in mind for this twopart miniseries than what ultimately resulted  especially given couturie's involvement in the superb hbo movie dear america  letters home from vietnam which utilized little original music and no original footage  letting the sights and sounds of the time speak for themselves  this presentation intercuts file footage with the dramatic production  but it doesn't do anyone any favours by trying to do too much in too little time  like so many of its ilk  it's seen from the point of view of one family  but the children of the family seem to be involved tangentially with almost every major event of the 's it's amazing that one of them doesn't go to the rolling stones gig at altamont  making it seem less like a period drama and more like a cliff notes version of the decade the makers rush through it so much that there's little or no time to give the characters any character  with the stick figures called our protagonists off screen for ages at a time  the children's father is especially clichéd  and then when they're back on blammo  it's something else  garry trudeau could teach the filmmakers a thing or two about doing this kind of thing properly  in fairness  jerry o'connell  jordana brewster  jeremy sisto

it have to be as shallow as the 's i like to think that cowriters bill couturie and robert greenfield had more in mind for this twopart miniseries than what ultimately resulted especially given couturie's involvement in the superb hbo movie dear americas letters home from vietnam which utilized little original music and no initial footage letting the sights and sounds of the time speak for themselves this presentation intercuts file footage with the dramatic production but it doesn't do anyone any favours by trying to do too much in too little time like so many of its ilk it's seen from the point of view of one family but the kids of the family seem to be involved tangentially with almost every major event of the 's it's amazing that one of them doesn't go to the rolling stones gig at altamont making it seem less like a period drama and more like a cliff notes version of the dozen the makers rush through it so much that there's little or no time to give the characters any nature with the stick figures called our protagonists off screen for ages at a time the children's father is especially corny and then when they're back on blammo it's something else garry trudeau could

world the between the cheeks trilogy  starring a wrestler named kane  and expects a little slice of art on a golden platter  if you do then you probably need to find something other than watching movies to occupy your time so what exactly are we to expect from a movie like this  well  here's what i was looking forward to  bad acting   a fairly nonexistent  clichéd storyline   kane walking around with a scrunched  sour face that indicates his nostrils just found the potato salad he misplaced a month ago   tons and tons of gore  well  if you're hungry for some so bad it's funny entertainment then this might satisfy your appetite because it delivers on all counts obviously  movies like this are best seen for free  but if you do choose to sacrifice box office bucks then have some fun and make a game out of it  the filmmakers are nice enough to introduce us to each of the annoying delinquents by flashing their names and legal offenses on the screen  this makes it easier for you to write down which ones you want to see killed and in what order  you and your friends can see whose predictions are most accurate i also suggest that you and your pals write down every single moment of stupidity and inanity that you can find  tally them up at the end and see who comes up with the most  i think my grand total was  can you beat that  i personally want to know how after years and a fire does this abandoned hotel still have electricity  running water  and a working elevator i know  i know  the filmmakers are assuming that if you pay to see this then you obviously don't put much thought into what you spend your money on and therefore likely won't put much thought into how silly the movie is  but that doesn't mean we can't point it out and laugh at it i also like how the city wants to turn this huge hotel which would be condemned and recommended for demolition by any sensible inspector into a homeless shelter and they think the best way to get it cleaned up is to give eight punks a few mops and brooms  uhhuh i think you pretty much know what to expect  but i feel the need to provide you with a couple of warnings  first  if you hate crowd interaction no matter the movie then you might want to stay away  the people in the audience acted like they were at an actual wrestling show  shouts of kill him  kane  and i hope you die first  and chokeslam  echoed through the theater  showcasing what i hope is not the best of what america has to offer  i usually don't appreciate such audience interaction  but for a cheesefest like this i thought the commentary added to the entertainment value  however  i can see how others could be annoyed by it second  and this shouldn't even warrant explanation  the film doesn't shy away from the gore  if watching a big ugly dude rip eyeballs right out of their sockets doesn't scream fun night at the movies  for ya then you know good and well to save your dough i must say that i was a little surprised by the extreme lack of dialogue on kane's part  i wasn't expecting him to put on an acting clinic  but i was hoping he'd have some cute little catchphrase like say goodnight his character's last name is goodnight right before he killed a victim  instead he uttered four words in the entire film  no  and i see it  but hey  he delivered them flawlessly if i were a bad guy in a movie then my catchphrase would be something like place your betts  or all betts are off  it'd rule and you know it  we need a new genre term for bad horror films like see no evil that induce so much unintentional laughter that you almost have to label them comedic  feel free to send me your suggestions  for now we'll just call 'em horlarious ,0.05625738948583603,1,all right let's be realistic about this nobody

america has to offer i usually don't appreciate such audience interaction but for a cheesefest like this i thought the commentary added to the entertainment value however i can see how others could be annoyed by it second and this shouldn't even warrant explanation the film doesn't shy away from the gore if watching a big ugly dude rip eyeballs right out of their sockets doesn't scream fun night at the movies for ya then you know good and well to save your dough i must say that i was a little surprised by the extreme lack of dialogue on kane's part i wasn't expecting him to put on an acting clinic but i was hoping he'd have some cute little catchphrase like say goodnight his character's last name is goodnight right before he killed a victim instead he uttered four words in the entire film no and i see it but hey he delivered them flawlessly if i were a bad guy in a movie then my catchphrase would be something like place your betts or all betts are off it'd rule and you know it we need a new genre term for bad horror films like see no evil that induce so much unintentional laughter that you almost have to label them comedic feel free to send me your suggestions for now we'll just call 'em horlarious,0.6364156007766724,19,0.9715768981181052,Y,0.03

0,disney has now made straighttovideo sequels to a good bunch of their many animated features  two of these were made for their classic  beauty and the beast well  these ones aren't really sequels  as they are both set in between the events of the first film  the first of these two straighttovideo films was beauty and the beast  the enchanted christmas which seems to be disliked by quite a few fans of its theatrical predecessor  but i think that can usually be expected with sequels  however  this second one  belle's magical world is definitely inferior the film features three short stories  all of which take place while belle is in the castle  and the place is under the spell of the enchantress  the first is the perfect word where a misunderstanding at the table between belle and the beast leads to trouble  and neither wants to be the first to apologize  the next story is fifi's folly where fifi and lumiere's fifth anniversary is coming up  and lumiere is unprepared  so belle helps him  however  fifi sees lumiere practicing romance with belle  and thinks they're actually in love  the film ends with the broken wing in this story  belle takes care of a bird with a broken wing  but a bird in the castle will probably mean trouble if the beast finds out  as he hates birds  the plot description i gave is for the original vhs version of disney's third beauty and the beast movie  apparently  in the dvd version  there is another story added called mrs  potts's party but i've only seen the original version  however  since i highly doubt that one story would stand out as a classic over the rest  i see no point in watching the special edition  anyway  the first thing i will say about belle's magical world is that the animation is very dimensional compared to what we're used to from disney  which would obviously disappoint many people  i didn't like beauty and the beast  the enchanted christmas that much  but you certainly can't say the same about its animation  i'm sure the stories in belle's magical world could entertain many kids mostly younger ones  i think  and each story has a moral  so they could also teach them some valuable lessons  however  for adults  the film really doesn't have a lot  i personally didn't find any good humour in it  found that the constant conflict between belle and the beast got tiring  and the stories did not impress me too much at all in any way they're not very well written  in the perfect word the way belle says to the beast  you're acting rude  and foolish  is a bit cheesy  and i think there are quite a few other cheesy moments in these stories by the time this straighttovideo movie first came out  i was around eleven or twelve years old  i don't know what i would have thought of it at the time  as i had lost interest in disney by then  and it would be years before i would gain any of that interest back  even when this movie was first released  i think i was a bit past the age group it was aimed at  i never saw beauty and the beast  the enchanted christmas until a couple months ago  but unlike that film  i never even heard of this one until recently  i think just after seeing the first sequel to disney's hit  well  as much as i like the theatrical original  i wouldn't have been missing much if i never became aware of this film's existence  for little kids  i'm sure belle's magical world can be highly entertaining  and probably somewhat educational with its morals  but i do not recommend it for adult disney fans ,0.20699873566627505,1,disney has now introduced straighttovideo sequels to a

eleven or twelve years old i don't know what i would have thought of it at the time as i had lost interest in disney by then and it would be years before i would gain any of that interest back even when this movie was first released i think i was a bit past the age group it was aimed at i never saw beauty and the beast the enchanted christmas until a couple months ago but unlike that film i never even heard of this one until recently i think just after seeing the first sequel to disney's hit well as much as i like the theatrical original i wouldn't have been missing much if i never became aware of this film's existence for little kids i'm sure belle's magical world can be highly entertaining and probably somewhat educational with its morals but i do not recommend it for adult disney fans,0.5901574492454529,9,0.9805054151624548,Y,0.01

1,i've read innumerable reviews talking about the superiority of the miniseries  i certainly can't agree on such a blanket statement  if you analyze all of the aspects of a video  film production  there are numerable areas where the film is arguably vastly superior certainly  many of the comments are valid with regard to particular areas of the miniseries  specifically regarding more threads customs officers and more developed threads such as the pakistani farmer and family  that said  i found catherine zetajones' character much more compelling as the desperate women  from poverty to riches who won't go back  that's a much more likable character than this cold women who didn't seem to have as much reason for her quick turn to evil  and yes  i understand  her children  she was desperate  i just didn't see her as being as desperate further  while i appreciated some of the more fleshed out story threads in the miniseries  benicio del toro's character was very compelling  an anchor for the film  that thread was changed as an alternative to the pakistani family in nothing but good ways  a fantastic adaptation  of course  i'm skeptical that someone so pure can exist within such a system  but i don't know enough about the politics of the nation to argue after watching the first episode of the miniseries  i actually rewatched the film  why  i kept reading about the fantastic acting  i found the performances in the first episode of the miniseries to be borderline laughable  certainly  this improved as the miniseries progressed  now having just finished both versions in a few days  i can't agree that the performances in the miniseries reached the same level as  say  benicio del toro  who was brilliant in the film  though ormand  paterson  shah  and lindsay duncan were very good  i also feel the police in the film far outclassed the miniseries  i was not impressed with the germans throughout finally  the dialogue  as delivered in the film  is much more nuanced  especially in the scenes which are almost verbatim  careful  you're beginning to sound like your husband  as opposed to hahahaha  you sound like karl  again  i found some of the acting in the mini series very unconvincing  this was a prime example other superior aspects of the film  in my opinion  score  cinematography  editing should i complain that the film wasn't longer  no  i think it was a fantastic adaptation given the format  the changes made stood on their own  i mean  would you sit in a theater for    hours  of course not miniseries  out of film  out of

film production there are numerable areas where the film is arguably vastly superior certainly many of the comments are valid with regard to especial areas of the miniseries specifically regarding more threads customs officers and more developed threads such as the pakistani farmer and relatives that say i found catherine zetajones' character much more compelling as the desperate women from poverty to riches who won't go back that's a much more likable character than this cold women who didn't seem to have as much reason for her quick turn to evil and yes i understand her children she was desperate i just didn't see her as being as desperate further while i appreciated some of the more fleshed out story threads in the miniseries benicio del toro's character was very compelling an anchor for the film that thread was changed as an alternative to the pakistani family in nothing but alright ways a fantastic adaptation of course i'm skeptical that someone so pure can exist within such a regime but i don't know enough about the politics of the nation to argue after watching the first mishap of the miniseries i actually rewatched the film why i kept reading about the fantastic acting i detected the performances in the first episode of the miniseries to be borderline laughable certainly this improved as the miniseries progress now having just finished both versions in a few times i can't agree that the performances in the miniseries reached the same grades as say benicio del toro who was brilliant in the film though ormand paterson shah and lindsay duncan were very good i also feel the police in the film far outclassed the miniseries i was not impressed with the germans throughout finally the dialogue as delivered in the film is much more nuanced especially in the scenes which are almost verbatim careful you're beginning to sound like your husband as opposed to hahahaha you sound like karl again i found some of the acting in the mini series very unconvincing this was a prime example other superior aspects of the film in my opinion score cinematography editing should i complain that the film wasn't longer no i think it was a fantastic adaptation given the format the changes made stood on their own i mean would you sit in a theater for hours of course not miniseries out of film out of,0.4463690519332886,12,0.9678698928996429,Y,0.03

in love with a woman of the night we all know pretty woman is a chick flick but you can't avoid them all  they'll eventually get you  pretty woman for me does two things  two terrible horrible ghastly things  firstly it portrays prostitution as a career more akin to that of a dancer  you know with absolutely great friends  leg warmers lots of giggling  borrowing each others make up  you see in the reality of pretty woman the prostitute and this is a street walker prostitute we're talking about here  has a great life  she's healthy happy with only the occasional whimper to explain her predicament  my feeling is this 'happy hooker' type protagonist is a lot more palatable than an even nearly realistic character  which for me begs the question if you make a movie about a type of person but are too chicken scared to adorn that player with the characteristics familiar to that role then why do it  if i make a film about a chef but don't want him to cook or talk about food or wear a white hat then why make a film about a chef in the first place  by bailing out and turning the hooker into a respectable dancer type the story misses the point completely and consequently never indulges in any of the moral or social questions that it could have  what a cop out  really really lame  secondly  'pretty woman' insults romance itself  edward lewis played by richard gere has no clue how to seduce or romance this 'lady' that is without his plastic friend  yep don't leave home without it  especially if you are a moron in a suit who has no imagination  out of of his romantic moments involve splashing cash in one way or another  even when he first meets her it's the lotus esprit turbo that does all the work  necklaces here diamonds there limos over there  money money money  where's the charm  where's the charisma  don't mention that attempt at the piano please girls who like this film will also be girls who like shopping more than most  guys who like this film will not even have realized that old eddy has less charm than a calculator  as they probably don't either so it wont have registered  more importantly anyone who likes this film will hate 'thieves highway' a wonderful story of which part is based on the same subject i'll finish on a songretty woman hangin round the street pretty woman  the kind i like to treat pretty woman  i don't believe you you're not the truth no one could spend as much as you mercypretty woman  wont you pardon me pretty woman  i couldn't help but see pretty woman  and you look lovely as can be do you lack imagination just like

the concept might work  hell it couldn't be any worse than the disappointing cats and dogs could it  then by december and i suddenly remembered the film i realised how likely the film was to suck  the fact it had been delayed in the uk made it seem inevitable it would be terrible  but the horrendous reviews just made me realise it was nigh on impossible for the movie to be any good  still i swallowed my feelings and went to see the film with a friend today  as i entered my screen i was mortified  it was the very first time i'd be seeing a movie with a friend and being the only two in the screen  little did i know for what i was about to endure  underdog to put it blunt is horrendous  it really is  imagine how bad you could think this movie is and then prepare yourself for a movie even worse  that is just how pathetic the movie is  while it aims to entertain kids it just seems an embarrassing mess that seems to insult kids rather than allow them to enjoy the movie  matters cannot be helped by the fact that the story is beyond lacklustre  the acting is generally poor  and the movie just feels like an overlong  tired and downright boring saturday cartoon  after a brief five minutes where i thought the movie might be passable the movie just suddenly seems to die and then limp on towards the already sign posted finale  i'm just amazed the movie was actually ever released  it's an embarrassment to disney  hell half their straight to video sequels are better than this  what's even more terrifying is the fact the ending leaves room for a sequel so lets get onto the acting cracks knuckles  okay let me be honest jason lee is decent  his voice suits the canine  and had he have been given a decent script he might have made the performance work  however  with such a dodgy script he just seems to flounder  in many ways it reminded me of bill murray in garfield  murray did what he could with what he had  but what he had wasn't enough to make it passable  then we get onto the human actors  and well the majority of atrocious  alex neuberger plays the friend of underdog  jack  my biggest concern is that anybody would even take him seriously in an audition  the scene where he gets to fly with underdog is perhaps the most cringe worthy scene in the past few years just because his acting is so poor  not once did i believe he was a real person  in fact part of me is still convinced he was a robot made specially for the movie  james belushi seems half dead in the film  he has nothing to work with  no decent lines  he just seems to wander around the set waiting to become relevant to the plot  which the writers try to do towards the end but do it in such a poor way its laughable  thankfully peter dinklage is the one redeeming factor of the movie  he is great as dr barsinister and seems to be having a laugh in the role  he steals every scene he is in  although that's hardly difficult when he shares screen time with the extremely annoying patrick warburton  the rest of the cast are even worse  especially taylor momsen  she just needs to end her acting career right now underdog also fails dramatically in terms of delivering anything like a funny scene  when the funniest scene involves underdog biting a can and causing dog food to explode everywhere you know there is something drastically wrong  this could be easily ignored if the movie had decent action or a good story  alas the movie is even worse in both of these terms  the effects are so ropey that any scene where underdog flies just seems absurd  and the dog uses his powers to such little effect that you frequently forget he has superpowers  what's the point in making a film about a super dog if the damned dog never appears super  the final fight also verges on embarrassing purely because its ten minutes of nothingness  the dog flies  other stuff happens  some stuff gets chucked about  all of this is irrelevant as this stuff is happening for the sake of stuff happening  the script as well is dodgy at best and downright pain inducingly awful at worst  when someone says look its a plane  no its a bird  no its a frog   yes you read that right  i just wanted to burst into tears there and then  actually i wanted to walk out by remained compelled to see whether it could get any lower than that point  this happens near the end so it doesn't thankfully overall underdog becomes the worst movie of at this early period  and is actually just as bad as last years epic movie  luckily for underdog  meet the spartans arrives over here soon and i expect that to be even worse  so in case you

0,the fallen ones starts with archaeologist matt fletcher casper van dien in the desert discovering the mummified remains of a foot tall giant  now there's something you don't see everyday  matt is working for property developer morton robert wagner who wants to build a holiday resort on the land  he calls in fellow archaeologist angela kristen miller for reasons i'm unsure of  anyway they both try to figure out what they've got on they're hands when some of the team go missing  morton calls in security guy ammon navid negahban to handle the situation  meanwhile ancient text translator the rabbi eli schmidtt tom bosley translates some ancient text as he would  is shocked to learn of a evil prophecy in which these giants will rise up  take over the world for the fallen one  or something like that  it's up to matt to save the day  the whole planet  written  directed by kevin vanhook  who also has a small role in the film as the ancient warrior leader at the start  i personally thought the fallen ones was a terrible film  it's as simple  straight forward as that  there are so many things that are just plain bad about the fallen ones both on a technical  conceptual level  the script doesn't make a whole lot of sense  it doesn't really get going until the final odd minutes by which time i had almost lost the will to live  the character's are awful  as clichéd as you like  the dialogue is bad as in very  very bad  the entire film is predictable  i mean it's not going to come as a surprise that casper van dien is going to save the day is it  it's not a huge surprise that the mummified giant is going to come back to life either so why wait until over an hour into the film when most of the audience will be in some sort of comatose state  this is bad  very bad  you have been warned director vanhook doesn't impress  the fight scenes are absolutely awful  why dress your bad guys up in a horrible shade of purple  they look naff  to give it a bit of credit the special effects

starts with archaeologist matt fletcher everchanging van dien in the saharan detect the mummified remains of a foot tall gargantuan now there's something you don't see everyday mattie is working for property developer morton robert wagner who wants to construction a holiday resort on the terrestrial he calls in fellow archaeologist angela kristen miller for grounds i'm unsure of anyway they both try to figure out what they've got on they're manos when some of the team go missing morton calls in security guy ammon navid negahban to handle the situation meanwhile ancient text translator the rabbi elly schmidtt tom bosley translates some ancient text as he would is shocked to learn of a evil prophecy in which these giants will rise up take over the world for the fallen one or something like that it's up to matt to savings the day the whole planet written directed by kevin vanhook who also has a small role in the film as the ancient warrior leader at the starts i personally thought the declined ones was a horrifying film it's as simple straight forward as that there are so many things that are just plain bad about the fallen ones both on a technical conceptual level the scenario doesn't make a whole lot of sense it doesn't truthfully get going until the definitive odd mn by which time i had nigh lost the will to live the character's are awful as clichéd as you like the dialogue is mala as in very very naughty the entire film is predictable i meaning it's not going to come as a surprises that everchanging minivan dien is going to save the today is it it's not a prodigious surprise that the mummified monumental is going to coming back to lives either so why wait until over an hour into the film when most of the audience will be in some sort of comatose state this is bad very bad you have been warned director vanhook doesn't impress the fight scenes are absolutely awful why dress your bad guys up in a horrible shade of purple they look naff to give it a

and does joe end up with susie  who loves him too the first and second times i saw anchors aweigh  i also saw it at the same time as i did on the town  the kelly  sinatra collaboration from both times i felt that anchors aweigh was the better film in terms of plotting and structureall the dances and songs fit the moment in the plot  and they develop the characters and story rather than hamper them  yet  both times i came away feeling that on the town is the better film overall  having now seen both films a third time  i still stand by that judgement  somehow on the town  as a film and a piece of entertainment  is just lighter  gayer  purely and simply happier the numbers are more outrageous and less integral to the plot  and yet somehow it works better than all the dances and singing in anchors aweigh  i'm not quite sure why this is  the typical argument is that the latter film is overlong  at almost two and a half hours  this is certainly a valid criticism to make  i certainly felt the length the first two times i saw it  however  it's also a film that grows on youthe more you see it  the shorter it feels and the more you appreciate the technical mastery involved in its making  and yet  something just doesn't hang together quite right  it feels almost as if the script was pored over  and every single moment when kelly could break into dance or sinatra into song was noted  and that's exactly what happened  no opportunity to shoehorn a musical number in was given up  and that's probably the film's biggest weakness  it has numbers give or take a few  and no matter how big a fan you are of kelly or sinatra  this really starts to turn one numb after a while  contrast this  for example  with the ten numbers in on the town  you might well feel that each song  each dance  can't be taken out of the film without leaving it lacking  and that's true  but that's also because the writers weren't more restrained in adding them in in the first place all this long preamble doesn't mean there's nothing good about anchors aweigh  the musical is splashy with great songs bursting out all over  like the duets between kelly and sinatra 'we hate to leave' 'i begged her' and 'if you knew susie'  the singing of sinatra 'what makes the sunset' 'the charm of you' and the best of all  'i fall in love too easily'  and without a doubt the always inventive  always breathtaking dancing of kelly  it's also hard to miss with a cast of this calibre  grayson is sweet and seems to improve on each viewing her voice becoming stunning rather than frightening jose iturbi's role is written sympathetically and he does a great job with it  even clarence's own brooklyn  pamela britton  is cute and charming  as close as one could get to betty garrett without being garrett herself  sinatra is adorable with those blue eyes and curls of his  and plays the innocent boyman wonderfully a role he reprises in on the town  his singing is  as usual  simply faultless from enunciation through to timing and phrasing  his solo numbers might seem to drag a little  but when you've got the voice of a century  showcasing it is probably as good a reason as any to slow up the rest of the film gene kelly's sheer genius in this film is worthy of its own paragraph  third in the billing behind sinatra and grayson respectively  anchors aweigh really is kelly's film  his joe brady is a believable  real characterhe's tough on the outside  glib and willing to lie when necessary to win a gal  but he's actually the biggest softy on the inside  kelly makes this charming rather than cloying  but also gives joe a real edge that you see in the scene when joe chases brooklyn around the room with a genuinely murderous look on his face and his breakfast tray in his hands  and the dancingagain  the film suffers from the 'too much of a good thing spoils the effect' syndrome  as it does with sinatra's singing  but once again  if it's gene kelly doing the softshoe  or tapping across the screen in a sailor's outfit or dressed up as a bandit chief  might as well err on the side of overdoing it  all of kelly's dances are breathtaking  be it the pareddown simplicity of his tap number with sinatra to 'i begged her' his 'mexican hat dance' with the sweet wideeyed little girl  or his lavish spanishinfluenced dance 'la cumparsita' of course  the classic image left in audiences' minds for all time would be kelly in his red  white and blue sailor suit  dancing with jerry mouse of 'tom  jerry' fame  a welldeserved golden film memory  to be sureit's not often that one can say you're impressed by the special effects in a film made in given the saturation of cgi in the contemporary film market  but gene and jerry still look great  with kelly always hitting his spots and looking exactly where he needs to look  it would turn out that just about the only people who could really keep up with gene kelly would be kelly himself in cover girl and a cartoon animation  it's doubtless that this first daring  inventive kelly dance with jerry has reserved a place for anchors aweigh in film history and the hearts of classic film buffs  but it's also notable for being the

1,anthony minghela's writer  director cold mountain is a carefully constructed  sensitive  and intelligent drama set in the social context of the confederacy during the civil war  which deals with the politics of the war in a very subtle and realistic manner  while it accurately depicts the brutality and inhumanity of that war  it also does something that many films related to this period to not handle as effectively  cold mountain studies the southern context from the inside out  and portrays changes among the nonslave owning common people wrought by the war  and  almost uniquely  cold mountain does not overgeneralize southerners  northerners or anybody else the film surfs through genres as needed  never presenting a dull moment  it is a romance  a war story  an actionadventure and

admits to ruby thewes renee zellweger  she is a master of everything useless ada's father passes on  and she is left to manage his modest estate by herself  with no experience of this sort  she struggles  and survives by holding the memory of inman close to her heart  ruby enters the picture as a tough young woman who has been raised by a drunk and negligent father  ruby has all the skills and abilities ada lacks  and as they become inseparable business partners  they grow to love one another as best friends  inman's experience is radically different  but something of a mirror image  during his participation in the war  he sees many friends killed for causes they don't really believe in  and decides to desert  nobody he meets comes to his rescue as he begins the thousand mile walk back to cold mountain and ada  and most of those he meets die the bulk of the film takes place during inman's long walk  following both of the protagonists as they live  learn  grow and change  an ongoing act of will borne of desperation preserves their intense passionate love  for inman  it is his only source of hope in a world of pure desperation  for ada  it is very much the same thing  but

1,minor spoilers followsteve allen opined that topical humor about serious events might be found by many to be acceptable based on the formula  tragedytimecomedy  before the german assault on poland was hardly a fun period and subsequent events  including the blitzkrieg following the sitzkrieg which took germany to the channel  resulted in the heroic evacuation at dunkirk and gave the world the sickening spectacle of a supine france prostrating its honor before the nazi conqueror the stuff of romance  comedy and a big dollop of serious drama  yep  director jeanpaul rappeneau  with a wellmatched and outstanding cast  creates in bon voyage a pastiche of events and scenes from history and from imagination that is hugely entertaining viviane denvers the sloeeyed and beautiful isabelle adjani is france's top actress as war clouds gather over europe what an overused cliche  sorry  a veteran selfvenerating bedhopper with many affairs to her credit  her inner motivation seems to be whatever is good for viviane is good for  viviane  following a premiere of her latest film after which a minister in the incompetent reynaud administration  jeanetienne beaufort gerard depardieu in an unusual role for him  signals his interest in her  she goes home only to tiredly encounter an exlover who doesn't understand the word no  she decisively resolves that issue but then frantically and histrionically enlists another former beau  the still besotted frederic gregory derangere  to help deal with the mess in her flat  frederic is a novelistinexpectation a comic accident that once again highlights  almost as a public service message  the importance of working windshield wipers puts frederic in jail on most serious charges  fortunately the breakout of the germans from their static positions forces a wholesale transfer of prisoners to the south of france but our boy escapes  making his way there privately rather than as a ward of the state the panic and fear in france as the germans swept to victory is well portrayed and a new twist enters the story  who should frederic encounter but the truly gorgeous young research assistant  camille virginie ledoyen who is accompanying the obligatory jewish refugee scientist  professor kopolski jeanmarc stehle  kopolski has some bottles of heavy water he needs to get to england  of course the germans musn't latch on to this vital ingredient for you know what this part is pure fictionthere was never any heavy water in france in just perrier  and camille is so winsome as well as dedicated what next  peter coyote as a supposed french journalist  alex winckler  be tipped off as to his name  he's really an officer in the abwehr german military intelligence  a spy  and he used to bed viviane too and wants a reprise of their affair  apparently the kind kopolski is the only major male character who doesn't want to have it off with the actress what follows is a series of adventures and mishaps that are seamlessly integrated to produce a very fastpaced and enjoyable film  partly a tribute to and a bit of a spoof on casablanca  this is is a remarkably funny movie except for the heavy nazi bits isabelle adjani

about serious events might be found by many to be acceptable based on the formula tragedytimecomedy before the tak assault on poland was barely a fun period and subsequent events including the blitzkrieg following the sitzkrieg which took tak to the channel resulted in the heroic evacuation at dunkirk and gave the world the sickening spectacle of a supine france prostrating its honor before the nazi conqueror the stuff of romance comedy and a big dollop of severe drama yep director jeanpaul rappeneau with a wellmatched and unpaid cast creates in okay voyage a pastiche of events and scenes from history and from imagination that is hugely entertaining viviane denvers the sloeeyed and beautiful isabelle adjani is france's top actress as war cloudy gather over europe what an overused cliche sorry a veterans selfvenerating bedhopper with many affairs to her credit her inner motivation seems to be whatever is good for viviane is alright for viviane hereafter a premiere of her latest film after which a minister in the incompetent reynaud administration jeanetienne beaufort gerard depardieu in an unusual role for him signals his interest in her she goes home only to tiredly encounter an exlover who doesn't understand the word no she decisively resolves that issue but then frantically and histrionically enlists another former beau the still besotted frederic gregory derangere to help deal with the mess in her flat frederic is a novelistinexpectation a comic accident that once again highlights approximately as a public service message the importance of working windshield wipers puts frederic in jail on most serious charges fortunately the breakout of the germans from their static positions forces a wholesale transfer of prisoners to the south of france but our boy escapes making his way there private rather than as a ward of the state the panic and fear in france as the germans swept to victory is well portrayed and a new twist enters the story who should frederic encounter but the truly gorgeous young research assistant camille virginie ledoyen who is accompanying the obligatory jewish refugee scientist professor kopolski jeanmarc stehle kopolski has some bottles of heavy water he needs to get to england of course the germans musn't latch on to this vital ingredient for you know what this part is pure fictionthere was never any heavy water in france in just perrier and camille is so winsome as well as dedicated what next peter coyote as a supposed french journalist alex winckler be tipped off as to his name he's really an officer in the abwehr german military intelligence a spy and he used to bed viviane too and wants a reprise of their affair apparently the kind kopolski is the only major male character who doesn't want to have it off with the actress what follows is a series of adventures and mishaps that are seamlessly integrated to produce a very fastpaced and enjoyable film partly a tribute to and a bit of a spoof on casablanca this is is a remarkably funny movie except for the heavy nazi bits isabelle adjani deserves kudos for the best portrayal i've seen in years of an adorably cute total narcissist

1,hey  this ralf westhoff seems to knows a lot about people  we have nine women and nine men taking part in a speed dating event  each person has five minutes to talk to each opposite  a good idea to make a movie out of these conversations  and even better  it works very  very well  the dialog is witty  original and authentic  each person is subtly characterized  without falling into the cliché trap  something that is unusual for german movies  remember  all these years  we germans were tormented with silly zeitgeist comedies such as workaholic or stadtgesprächbut now the time has come for young german directors to do their own thing and take the risk of producing movies which are entertaining and funny and intelligent and sensitive at the same time  the timing of shoppen is good  too  although it presents mainly dialog  it keeps the tension and interest  after a while  you actually become curious to see how this man and that woman would do  some of the participants meet later on for a twosome  it's fun to see them interacting together in real life of course  the film has a few drawbacks  it's not very cinematic but can such a movie be   the musical soundtrack could have been better  but all this is only marginal the most important thing about this movie  we have some damn good actors here  imagine this  all of them are still pretty unknown even here in germany most were derived from the munich or bavarian theater scene  but i predict that out of the main actors  at least will quickly become very wellknown in the movie and tv scene over here  it's great to see so many fresh and at the same time talented faces  welldone for those who want to read more  here's a rundown of all actorsspoilers sebastian weber  silent waters are deep  memorize his flower garden monologue  you can win any woman's heart with this one anna böger  a hell of a woman  every time she opens her mouth  you can't help but laugh and feel good  listen how she pronounces asshole and calls the pink shirt guy a bürscherlfelix hellmann  the bürscherl from above is fun to watch  the inconvenient truth is that there are too many of those guys around  his looks somewhat reminded me of flo weber of sportfreunde stillerkatharina schubert  this woman has everything  love  hope  despair  beauty  her do you want children scene is a classic  a great actress of whom we will hear again  no doubt david baalcke  now is this guy a loser or not  almost as authentic as paul giamatti in sideways i hope this is not method acting julia koschitz  the good looking woman in the circle  julia used to play theater in my hometown  kudos  i think she will appear in many tv series to come martin butzke  the revolutionary guy catches the cutest and most conventional woman in the end  would you like to share a taxi with this guy kathrin von steinburg  she gave a stunning performance in tatort last year  her trancelike performance in this movie is no less  see her beautiful face and hear her dirty

women and nine men taking part in a speed date event each person has five minutes to talk to each opposite a good idea to make a movie out of these conversations and even better it works very very bah the dialog is mental original and true each person is subtly labelled without falling into the cliché trap something that is unusual for german movies remember all these years we germans were tormented with silly zeitgeist comedies such as workaholic or stadtgesprächbut now the time has come for young german directors to do their own thing and take the risk of producing movies which are entertain and funny and intelligent and sensitive at the same time the timing of shoppen is good too although it presents mainly dialog it keeps the voltage and interest after a while you actually become bizarre to see how this man and that woman would do some of the participants meet later on for a twosome it's fun to see them interacting together in real life of course the film has a few drawbacks it's not very cinematic but can such a movie be the musical soundtrack could have been better but all this is only marginal the most important thing about this movie we have some damn good actors here imagine this all of them are still pretty unknown even here in germany most were derived from the munich or bavarian theater scene but i predict that out of the main actors at slightest will quick become very wellknown in the movie and tv scene over here it's great to see so many costs and at the same time talented faces welldone for those who want to read more here's a rundown of all actorsspoilers sebastian weber silent waters are deep memorize his flower garden monologue you can win any woman's heart with this one anna böger a hell of a woman every time she opens her mouth you can't help but laugh and feel good listen how she pronounces asshole and calls the pink shirt guy a bürscherlfelix hellmann the bürscherl from above is fun to watch the inconvenient truth is that there are too many of those guys around his looks somewhat reminded me of flo weber of sportfreunde stillerkatharina schubert this woman has everything love hope despair beauty her do you want children scene is a classic a great actress of whom we will hear again no doubt david baalcke now is this guy a loser or not almost as authentic as paul giamatti in sideways i hope this is not method

0,well  i can honestly say that this is the first time that i experienced a film that had literally no meat or potatoes in it  the entire film felt like it was just the salad with no main course  the story line was fallible and laughable  the characters were onedimensional  the realism was out the window  and the animation was done by fouryear olds  does that cover it  i have never been more embarrassed for a concept in my entire life  i have never read the comics or seen the other programs with this character  but from the looks of the other reviews i am not off base with my observation to begin  the story moved too quickly  for someone new to this character and situations  i needed more built into creating the reasons instead of finding the solution  i have seen other anime if you could call this one an anime that do great things with their characters because they take the time to develop them  there was nothing set aside for lady death  in a few short scenes  we see her train with cremator and instantly become this aggressive shebeast of hell  this was hard for me to swallow  considering moments before she was introduced as this weak and feeble woman controlled by her father  suddenly  she is immersed with hatred and can do battle with an existence that has been around for millions of years  this was absurd  the presentation of lady death was poor  to say the least  i felt as if she was nothing more than an animated character instead of a desperate woman with revenge on the mind  for me  it just didn't work  she was nothing more than eyecandy for prepubescent boys wanting to ogle the mass quantities of skin that she suddenly grew on her chest when training with cremator  oh  i felt sick just watching her  the same goes for the character of cremator  who was this random person  the explanation they gave wasn't enough  and instead i was left with more incoherent babbling than actual development  it is a very sad day in hell when we forgo characters to show more violence and action  especially in an animated feature next  there was lucifer himself  let me just say that i think i could do battle with the king of hell and survive  he was weak  his voice was laughable  and he just didn't represent the image that i had in my mind  it was as if disney was in control and wanted to make him semipc  he lacked the darkness and corrupt nature that lucifer embodies  he was not the ruler of hell  but instead just a lackey that had a bigger place to live  speaking of living or dying  how can you die again in hell  that was a concept that definitely needed more explanation  most of the characters were worrying about dying  when they didn't even consider the option that they were already dead  that is how they got to hell  i think it was this level of thinking that ruined the film for me  i didn't quite capture the notion that your soul was still in a solid body in hell  but that could just be me or maybe it was because there was no development in this story  there was nothing built  just preparing the battle sequences were hysterically bad  the animation in this cartoon felt like it was made in the early s  there was nothing impressive about the way that this film was drawn  why are we  america  so behind on animation  it is huge in asia  and it is creeping in hardcore here because we keep making films like lady death that do not challenge or use any part of imagination  we are cheap  and this film shows it overall  this film was bad  the animation coupled with the horrendous voice work was cheap  i had head somewhere that this film as in production for a long time  which is hard to understand because i think i could have made this film on my credit card  the production was horrendous as well as the story  nothing was developed  leaving huge gaping plot holes that nearly everyone fell into  the strength of the characters was missing  and nothing was explained  i wasted my time with this one and would like to warn others so that when death does come  you don't find yourself in my state and regretting the fact that you wasted minutes on this piece of garbage blah  grade   out of

school so it in no way relates to this film  but  hey  it's a slasher flick  those are part of the fun  also  the underutilization of characters was heavily exhibited in this film  there were six main characters not including the security guard and  to be honest  only three or four were really used  two characters the token black guy and some other girl that wasn't important enough to get a label barely spoke  between them  i'd estimate about five or six lines total  also  the girls other than one weren't formed well enough to differentiate them from one another  they could've replaced each of the girls with one another repeatedly throughout the film and i wouldn't have noticed the difference  the pacing  however  works well as the horror begins right from the start and rarely ceases  the atmosphere is utilized well and the direction reveals some truly chilling moments    although  the overall appearance is a bit cheaplooking due to  what i assume is  lowgrade camera equipment and operation  the ending  though i liked the idea they were going for  was fairly poorly done  it felt rushed and without explanation enough to make it effective  with the amount of time they spent running around looking for nothing  they could've spent a little bit more time on the conclusion to make sure it didn't feel like some random event thrown in for no good reason which is a flaw many

1,there are two distinct ways to enjoy this snappily written  seminal tv show the godfather to xfiles and buffy  etc  as a monster show it scared the hell out of me when i was a kid   or as a wellwritten  acted gumshoe  filmnoir  it works on both levels  the scariness may have been diluted over the years it was made in the mids  but i was pleasantly surprised upon rediscovering the show via dvd that i actually enjoy it more now for the latter reasons  the late darren mcgavin is karl kolchak  an eccentric  tenacious  rumpled newsman  monsterhunter who  in pursuit of a story  always finds a supernatural angle  much to the pain of kolchak's overstressed  putupon boss tony vincenzoplayed with tremendous worldweariness by the also late  great simon oaklan you can practically feel the pain of his budding ulcers   the interplay between these characters is crackling and witty much like star trek's spock and mccoy  only more acidic   over the course of two pilot tv movies and a oneseason series  kolchack fought vampires  robots  werewolves  witches  zombies  government conspiracies  aliens  and ancient legends sounds like the entire yr  run of the xfiles  in one season   and kolchak did it first  and as for composer gil melle's cool  partlywhistled main title music  well  xfiles creator chris carter calls mike snow's very similar xfiles main title theme an 'homage ' both

mcgavin is karl kolchak an eccentric obstinate rumpled newsman monsterhunter who in pursuit of a story always finds a supernatural angle much to the pain of kolchak's overstressed putupon boss tony vincenzoplayed with tremendous worldweariness by the besides delayed great simon oaklan you can practically feel the pain of his budding ulcers the interplay between these personages is hissing and witty much like superstar trek's spock and mccoy only more acidic over the course of two pilot tv filmmaking and a oneseason series kolchack fought vampires robots werewolves witches zombies govt conspiracies aliens and ancient legends sounds like the entire olds run of the xfiles in one evilness and kolchak did it first and as for compose gil melle's cool partlywhistled main title music bah

1,i had lost faith in sooraj r  barjatya after the movie main prem ki deewani hoon  then a year back now i saw promos for vivah which looked good  but i didn't want to waste my hard earned money watching it in cinema  when the film first came out on dvd i rented it and watched and i loved the movie and took back my words for sooraj  i just finished watching it yesterday again and this time i thought i have to review this movie  sooraj r  barjatyagot it right this time  okay i was not a huge fan of hum app ke hai kaun  but i have always loved manie pyar kiya  after manie pyar kiya to me i think vivah is barjatyas best work  i hardly ever cry in a movie but this movie made me feel like crying  if you have ever been in love before then there will be many moments that will touch you in this movie  the movie is just too sweet and will have you falling in love with it  my view a much underrated movie the story of this movie you might call desi and very old times  but to me it seemed modern because the two couples which are getting an arrange marriage are aware it's an old tradition  it's done in present times  lots of people don't believe in this arrange marriage  but i do  the journey between the engagement and wedding which will always be special and this movie shows it clearly  when prem meets poonam for the first time  they show it how it is and that's reality and my parents where saying that's how they got married and it showed it in a way which is so real yes people the way prem and poonam meet in this movie is how most marriages happen  it was a very sweet  you feel nervous yet excited  the song do ajnabe shows that very well  getting back to the story yes it's a journey which you soon get glued to between prem and poonam shahid kapoor and amrita rao and there families  a twist occurs in this movie which is really good  the last mins you all will be reaching for the tissue box what makes this film so amazing is the chemistry between prem and poonam  how they fall for each other is too sweet  simple boy and simple girl  when they first meet during and after the song do anjane ajnabe it's very sweet to watch  she hardly says anything and prem does all the talking being honest with her about his past and the girl he liked and him smoking  then it leads on to them all having a family trip and then that's when they really do fall for each other  it makes you just want to watch the couple and watch all the sweet moments they have  another factor is that poonam chichi is really mean to her and you feel sorry for poonam because she has been treated bad and makes you want to see her happy and when she finally finds happiness  you too start feeling happy with her the movie basically makes you fall in love with poonam more then just prem  when she finds happiness through prem you want her to stay happy and also hope nothing goes wrong because the character is shown as a sweet simple girl  which brings me to performances and amrita roa as poonam is amazing in the movie  her best work till date you will fall in love with this innocent character and root her on to find happiness  shahid kapoor as prem is amazing too  he is poonam support in the film  he is her happiness the movie  together they share an amazing chemistry and i have never seen a cuter couple since srk and kajol  if ishq vishk didn't touch you to telling you how cute they are together this surely will  mujhe haq hai the song and before that is amazing chemistry they show  scenes which touched me was when prem takes poonam to his room and shows her that's where they will be staying and he opens her up and they have a moment between them which is too sweet  again if you have ever been in love with someone that much these scenes you can defiantly connect to  the film is just the sweetest thing you will see ever the direction is spot on  to me a good movie is basically something that can pull me in and stop me believe for this hours what is being seen here is fake and there is a camera filing them  to me this film pulled me in and for those three hours i felt really connected to the movie  the songs you will only truly like when you have seen the movie as they are songs placed in the situation after i saw the movie i been playing the songs non stop  the music is amazing  the story is simply amazing too what more can i ask for what i can finally say it  rarely do we get a movie that makes us feel good  this movie after you have seen it will make you feel really good and make you want to be a better person  its basically the sweetest journey ever  its basically showing you they journey between engagement and marriage and many people say it's the bestest part of your life well this movie actually shows you way do people actually
