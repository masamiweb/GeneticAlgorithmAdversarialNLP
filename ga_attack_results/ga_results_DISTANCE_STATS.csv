fact  he was as lackluster as can be  he actually sucked what little energy there was in the program  dry  how he got that job was the second biggest mystery of the show the first was how did they pick the competitors for this program  this was literally a talentfree talent show  ok  perhaps that's an exaggeration  and granted  the performers all have to be relatively close in ability  because if they were not  there wouldn't be a contest  if only one person was good  there would be no suspense  so  i get that they all needed to be comparable  but they all should have had some chops  additionally  the judges were running a singing academy  so the program was part fame  as well  clearly these performers desperately needed those lessons  but you need some extremely talented people to teach those with little talent to be talented  and that definitely wasn't what was happening here it seemed in casting the show  the priority was on the homelife elements  as all of the players were very attractive to look at  in equal parts to how badly they vocalized  but the filmed segments in their house were so chopped and sliced  you couldn't get into the stories that were starting to happen  so the show didn't capture the events there  either as badly devised as all of that was  the one had an incredible  unbelievable  fatal design flaw built into the results that made it completely laughable the audience phoned in their votes for who they liked the best  just like on ai  but then  after the audience vote was revealed  the bottom three contestants were forced to sing a final song  the music experts  based on that performance  chose one person from the three to save for the following week  and then  the contestants who were safe got to vote for who they wanted to keep from the remaining two  sending the remaining contestant home the design flaw was that the contestants had the final say  i mean  if you were in a music competition and you wanted to get as far along the path as you could  would you vote to keep the better singer  or would you try to get rid of your toughest rival  any first season viewer of cbs's survivor could answer that one  and that's exactly what happened on the program  the person who had the better potential was lost  and the contestants voted back the one who had no talent at all  on top of that  the contestant who was just saved from the bottom by the experts was also allowed to vote against the remaining two  it was a complete farce  maybe if they let the contestants vote first  at least the experts would save the

in to  because this subplot has absolutely no place in the movie  despite the fact that the rest of the movie is as well  this subplot is completely superfluous and unnecessary  the story is based on a couple of rival sororities at the beloved f u  which exists as one of those universities that contains a grand total of one sorority until the rejects form their own in order to get back at the snobs in the other one  this new sorority  help out the seals h o t s   is a sorority supposedly based on helping seals the seal subplot is another one that doesn't really belong in the movie  and little attention is paid to the meaning of that name beyond having a seal running around here and there throughout the movie  this is going to sound weird  but there was actually one scene that i was pretty impressed with in this movie  one shot that i was impressed with  i should say  about midway through the movie  one of the girls in pi  the rival sorority  is pouring alcohol into the punch  and she pours some for herself in a glass and drinks it  oddly enough  what she does as she drinks that alcohol reminds me of something that charlie chaplin would do  which really brightened up the movie  obviously  nothing in this movie comes close to anything that chaplin ever did  but that shot alone raised my score for the movie from a to a as a whole  however  the movie is exactly what you would expect it to be  a lot of people running around looking for excuses to take off their clothes i liked how the removeonepieceofclothingforeveryscore in the football game at the end was one of the girls' ideas  riiiiiiiiight   and not much thought is put into much of anything else  there is  for example  a scene early in the film when a couple of the pi girls pour hot sauce into the refreshments at a h o t s  party  accidentally getting caught in an incriminating photograph the girl taking the picture didn't realize that she photographed them at the time  although the photograph never comes up for any reason later in the film  i've seen movies like this before  it's kind of like gator bait but without the violence and the rednecks and coffy wasn't far off  even barb wire is much the same  just with a bigger budget and more silicon  thankfully  maxim's bmovie list contains only a few more comedies  because while these cheesy teen t films are entertaining every once in a

ventures forth to investigate  what he finds is a world filled with new sounds  a new kind of music driving and penetrating sounds that assault the senses and make him feel alive and welcome  and he knows that at long last his time has come  that it is time for him and those like him to come out into the open and face the world on their terms  toward that end he becomes the front man for a band a

chosen to rule by her side as her king  lestat  and at the concert  rest assured  akasha will be in attendance  without fail  make no mistake  this is lestat's story  and rymer presents it amid a setting rich with atmosphere and with some exquisite moments  though his film has less bite to it than say  interview with the vampire ' or bram stoker's dracula ' he sets a good pace  and there are some scenes that provide some real thrills  but overall the film isn't as soaked in menace as it could be  or as much as one might expect  in the final tally  in fact  the amount of flesh that is incinerated wins out over actual bloodletting  though there is more than a taste of gore  and more than a fair share of lips and mouths dripping with the red stuff  there's some good f  x on hand  too  especially in the sequences that accentuate the speed of the vampires  as they move and hurtle through the air faster than the naked eye can discern  it's a decent job by rymer  but he could have put more teeth into it had he played up the alienation hinted at by lestat  as it is  you get a sense of his detachment  but not enough to get you totally involved  in interview with the vampire ' tom cruise brought some charismatic star power to the role of lestat  but townsend is even more effective  with a look and an attitude that captures lestat perfectly  he plays him with a sense of acceptance  and under closer scrutiny you may even find a hint of remorse and longing  it's a good performance  and one that sells his character convincingly  as marius  vincent perez does a nice job

0,i am a pretty much a sucker for those ghost hunter shows  from the cheesy mockumentaries like discovery channel's the haunting to scooby doo reality shows like ghost hunters when i saw promos for a's paranormal state i knew i was going to watch  especially when paranormal state was juxtaposed against a weak monday night football game by the end of the pilot of paranormal state when the main character in this reality dance macabre gives a creepy kid a bottle of max von sydow holy water and reassures him by telling this boy that he  too  had a unspecified bad experience as a child with things that came out of the closet and the  catholic  church gave him a holy water to fend off the things coming out of the closet i knew i should have given monday night football another shot the shtick behind paranormal state is a group of penn state students all got together and started their own ghost hunting club  or society  or super adventure club  and they run around pennsylvania researching the most terrible hauntings and the lost plot to an m  night shymalan movie the they is kind of a misnomer  really paranormal state revolves around a nittany lion named ryan buell who would probably be running penn state's yearly anime convention if it wasn't for this show  he is often accompanied on investigations by hot coeds and some other people seen in the credits but rarely caught on camera  hey  are they ghosts too  this is ryan buell's show  paranormal state is his vehicle as we like to say in the biz  and  oh  what a dull ride in a vehicle he can be did i mention ryan narrates the entire episode of paranormal state in a star dateless director's log voice over  almost immediately that gets annoying because the obvious intention is to give ryan's ghost hunting some gravitas  but his filtered monotone does nothing but provoke grunts and laughs  seriously  every serious intonation sounds like the radio chatter from a call of duty video game the investigations  the plot that each episode revolves around  are interesting on the surface  no haunted inns or restaurants to be found in paranormal state this is a show about fearing the unknown like a good catholic boy and by god they give you stuff to fear  small children are harassed  things loom in the dark  voices encourage the living to kill  and the aleister crowely in me rubs my hands  of the two episodes i watched each revolved around violent  nasty hauntings tied to violent  nasty deaths  maybe maybe not  everything in paranormal state is shorthanded into half hour  dog the bounty  er  ghost hunter blocks  every time there is an interesting  verifiable shred of evidence  the murder of a family in a farmhouse in the s  the proof is waved in front of the viewer like a con artist trying to convince you a stack of papers currently under your nose is proof of that ten million coming from nigeria and then yanked away before you can get a good gander  at least with scifi channel's ghost hunters there is a somewhat overexhaustive need to trot out every possible shred of evidence and present it to the viewer  evps that could be a rat farting  cold spots in a drafty house  and orbs that even the ghost hunters themselves discount as dust  it is a sort of scooby doo like approach that makes ghost hunters  almost believable whereas paranormal state claims to have evps but gives the viewer a ten second video clip of a wave file in garage band with no audio  yep  see  an evp  right  people are claiming to see dark figures in the basement  well  we will just go and see about that  while leaving the night vision camera on an enthralling stationary shot of the living room  ryan  the intrepid leader of this pack of penn state graduates  is claiming to see visions of a demon's name he knows and that might be involved in a paranormal haunting  but he can't tell us  the audience  or his team of gothed out undergrads  because  he can't  you never say a demon's name out loud  ryan informs the wide eyed coed who dare inquires well  how very very convenient for you  especially since this is a television show where the audience cannot read your mind paranormal state is all turn and no prestige  the audience gets told what is supposedly happening but you never see an ounce of proof that the creepy kid is seeing dead people  not even grainy video of a chair moving  or a black blob running between prison cells  nothing  you are just told what happened by ryan in yet another mechanical voice over if you are going to try and spook me dress it up a little  if you are trying to sway me  show me a orb or a blob and have the fat chick who works days at hot topic tell me why that black orb is really the spirit of an ax murderer  and if you want to make me watch a ghost hunting show give me something besides trotting out lorraine warren by the second episode paranormal state is weak sauce  not really worth watching unless you are hard up for tv time  or just have that thin of a dvd collection  or unless you want to know what really happened in that closet with the holy water ,0.01808794587850571,1,i am a pretty supremely a sucker for those ghost hunter shows from the

gave him a hallowed water to fend off the things coming out of the closet i knew i should have given monday night football another shot the shtick behind paranormal state is a group of penn state students all got together and started their own ghost hunting club or society or super adventure club and they executes around pennsylvania researching the most horrifying hauntings and the lost plot to an m night shymalan movie the they is kinds of a misnomer really paranormal state revolves around a nittany lion named ryan buell who would probably be running penn state's yearly anime convention if it wasn't for this show he is often accompanied on investigations by hot coeds and some other people seen in the credits but rarely caught on camera hey are they ghosts too this is everchanging buell's show uncanny state is his vehicle as we like to say in the biz and oh what a dull ride in a vehicle he can be did i mention everchanging narrates the entire episode of paranormal state in a star dateless director's log voices over almost immediately that gets annoying because the obvious intention is to give ryan's ghost hunting some gravitas but his filtered monotone does nothing but provoke grunts and laughs seriously every serious intonation sounds like the radio chatter from a call of duty video game the investigations the plot that each episode revolves around are interesting on the surface no haunted inns or restaurants to be found in paranormal state this is a show about fearing the unknown like a good catholic boy and by god they give you stuff to fear small children are harassed things loom in the dark voices encourage the living to kill and the aleister crowely in me rubs my hands of the two episodes i watched each revolved around violent nasty hauntings tied to violent nasty deaths maybe maybe not everything in paranormal state is shorthanded into half hour dog the bounty er ghost hunter blocks every time there is an interesting verifiable shred of evidence the murder of a family in a farmhouse in the s the proof is waved in front of the viewer like a con artist trying to convince you a stack of papers currently under your nose is proof of that ten million coming from nigeria and then yanked away before you can get a good gander at least with scifi channel's ghost hunters there is a somewhat overexhaustive need to trot out every possible shred of evidence and present it to the viewer evps that could be a rat farting cold spots in a drafty house and orbs that even the ghost hunters themselves discount as dust it is a sort of scooby doo like approach that makes ghost hunters almost believable whereas paranormal state claims to have evps but gives the viewer a ten second video clip of a wave file in garage band with no audio yep see an evp right people are claiming to see dark figures in the basement well we will just go and see about that while leaving the night vision camera on an enthralling stationary shot of the living room ryan the intrepid leader of this pack of penn state graduates is claiming to see visions of a demon's name he knows and that might be involved in a paranormal haunting but he can't tell us the audience or his team of gothed out undergrads because he can't you never say a demon's name out loud ryan informs the wide eyed coed who dare inquires well how very very convenient for you especially since this is a television show where the audience cannot read your mind paranormal state is all turn and no prestige the audience gets told what is supposedly happening but you never see an ounce of proof that the creepy kid is seeing dead people not even grainy video of a chair moving or a black blob running between prison cells nothing you are just told what happened by ryan in yet another mechanical voice over if you are going to try and spook me dress it up a little if you are trying to sway me show me a orb or a blob and have the fat chick who works days at hot topic tell me why that black orb is really the spirit of an ax murderer and if you want to make me watch a ghost hunting show give me something besides trotting out lorraine warren by the second episode paranormal state is weak sauce not really worth watching unless you are hard up for tv time or just have that thin of a dvd collection or unless you want to know what really happened in that closet with the holy water,0.6699289679527283,12,0.9815549385164616,Y,0.01,6,194

0,if my memory is correct  when this movie was released it came across as something of a comedy  a funny look at the adult entertainment industry  if that's what it's supposed to be  it doesn't really work  it just isn't that funny  setting that rather significant since this is called a comedy  failure aside  since i have no personal knowledge of the subject matter  i'll avoid comment about the authenticity of the story  which deals with the goings on behind the scenes in a toronto massage parlour  except to say that  if this is true  the life is pretty dull  for over an hour  this movie really doesn't give us much of anything except some background knowledge of the main characters  conrad is the newly hired manager of the massage parlour whose basic job apparently is to make sure the girls aren't giving full service  a euphemism for actual sex  as for the girls themselves  betty's goal is to buy a parlour of her own so that she can run her own business  cindy is an illegal immigrant to canada working to support her family back home and leah is  well  leah is a somewhat strange  undefined character with a nipple fetish  true  who seems to be in the business because  well  because she's in it  i have no idea what her character was about  those three may well fairly reasonable composite characters who accurately represent the motivations of the women who get involved in this business the movie meanders about and doesn't offer much until the twist reveals conrad to be the bad guy  we should have gotten to that point sooner  the only thing truly interesting here was that part of the story  conrad's secret plan and the revenge plotted against him by the girls  that plan for revenge was pretty good  and you're grateful when it comes out because basically up to that point you're wondering why you wasted your time with this  had the story been more focused on the revenge  this might have actually been a fairly funny movie the performances from the leads were all ok  although i didn't think anyone came across as outstanding  all four characters were a bit shallow  cindy was a sympathetic character  and so was conrad for a while  although he turns out to be the bad guy of the movie  given the subject matter  there's surprisingly little nudity and what there is is restricted to one scene  in fact  there even a certain air of innocence around a lot of this  as for the overall quality of the movie  it's a lowbudget effort  which shows  although you expect a certain griminess  i suppose  of a movie set in the context of a body rub parlour  so that's forgivable  it certainly says something  though  that this was released years ago now and is still the only credit on writerdirector soo lyu's resume and  given the normal lack of depth in the canadian film industry  that it wasn't even deemed worthy of being nominated for any genie awards  the canadian version of the oscars    and i'm being a bit generous with that

1,few would argue that master animation director hayao miyazaki is one of the few to hold this ability no  too many are focused on john lassiter's amazing ability to steal other movies plots  turn them into pretty puppet shows and then be lauded as a genius    but i digress miyazaki has given us film after film that deals with important mature issues usually ecologically themed  and has an intelligent script that even the most jaded viewer who would normally despise any film that was animated could thoroughly enjoy if given the chance  still  miyazaki  almost  never forgets who will undoubtedly be in the audience of these movies children that said  i am at a loss to think of another filmmaker with this ability  where else are you going to have a film where a three year old my nephew link will sit still throughout the move  enthralled  a year old my niece amber loving it all her own and able to appreciate the star power of frankie jonas and noah cyrus  a year old my nephew aaron who's review was of course it was good  everything miyazakisan does is good  a year old animation fan brought to tears by the powerful directing and gorgeous animation er  that would be me  and a year old woman my mother able to connect with the mother characters and i'm betting the older charas too and loving the cuteness of the child characters and that is what i respect most about miyazakisan  he seems to speak to his audience in a completely different way than the average filmmaker  on the surface  ponyo could be seen as a simple story about a little fishgirl who gets a taste of the human world and wants to join it and the friend she makes there  a little boy names soske somewhat like the little mermaid  but there is an entire different level at play here  true to form  miyazaki populates his film with intensely strong female characters ponyo's mother  soske's mother  the older ladies in a nursing home are all genuine characters with minds of their own and extremely strong willed but the girl who takes the cake is ponyo herself  once she decides that she likes the human world  she simply uses her own will to achieve her dreams  her father is trying to keep her innocent  and keep her a magical fish  but young ponyo knows what she wants and becomes human out of simply her own determination  once human  she teams up with her friend  soske  whom she loves very much although maybe not as much as ham  soske is asked to be the man of the house at age five when his mother lisa decides she has to help the people at the rest home where she works during a typhoon that has been inadvertently caused by ponyo on her quest to become human  frankie jonas yes  he's related to the jonas brothers  can we just get past that please  gives  perhaps  the best performance in the film as young soske which is good since he has the most lines  his character is also strong willed  but also very respectful and friendly characteristics you're not likely to find in a child character on this side of the pacific in the end  ponyo's father  fujimoto must cope with his daughter's decision and his estranges wife's wishes to allow her to be human  he hopes that ponyo and soske will remember him fondly  and once again  miyazaki refuses to allow a character to become the stereotypical bad guy  although miyazaki has for some reason received some criticism for this  it is  honestly  what makes his movies magical and yet relatable  no one in real life is completely a bad person  all humans are various shades of gray  and that is exactly what miyazaki does with his characters  and then there's the animation itself  in a time when cgi would certainly have helped with the copious amounts of effects shots in this film  especially the water  miyazaki has chosen to incorporate no cgi whatsoever  certainly the hand drawn animation was colored by digital means  but every film in this was handdrawn and i  for one  was extremely grateful for that  the character animation was extremely fluid  and there even appeared to be some lipsync going on quite unusual for an anime film  the backgrounds seemed to be rendered with colored pencil and had an effect all its own on the audience  this is what animation used to look like and what it should look like  in the end  i found ponyo to be thoroughly enjoyable  certainly not miyazaki's best in my opinion  that honor is still held by kiki's delivery service  but still a star fun movie for the entire family ,0.9842775464057922,0,few ought argue that master animate director hayao miyazaki is eden of the few to

make a movie out of these conversations  and even better  it works very  very well  the dialog is witty  original and authentic  each person is subtly characterized  without falling into the cliché trap  something that is unusual for german movies  remember  all these years  we germans were tormented with silly zeitgeist comedies such as workaholic or stadtgesprächbut now the time has come for young german directors to do their own thing and take the risk of producing movies which are entertaining and funny and intelligent and sensitive at the same time  the timing of shoppen is good  too  although it presents mainly dialog  it keeps the tension and interest  after a while  you actually become curious to see how this man and that woman would do  some of the participants meet later on for a twosome  it's fun to see them interacting together in real life of course  the film has a few drawbacks  it's not very cinematic but can such a movie be   the musical soundtrack could have been better  but all this is only marginal the most important thing about this movie  we have some damn good actors here  imagine this  all of them are still pretty unknown even here in germany most were derived from the munich or bavarian theater scene  but i predict that out of the main actors  at least will quickly become very wellknown in the movie and tv scene over here  it's great to see so many fresh and at the same time talented faces  welldone for those who want to read more  here's a rundown of all actorsspoilers sebastian weber  silent waters are deep  memorize his flower garden

calls the pink shirt guy a bürscherlfelix hellmann  the bürscherl from above is fun to watch  the inconvenient truth is that there are too many of those guys around  his looks somewhat reminded me of flo weber of sportfreunde stillerkatharina schubert  this woman has everything  love  hope  despair  beauty  her do you want children scene is a classic  a great actress of whom we will hear again  no doubt david baalcke  now is this guy a loser or not  almost as authentic as paul giamatti in sideways i hope this is not method acting julia koschitz  the good looking woman in the circle  julia used to play theater in my hometown  kudos  i think she will appear in many tv series to come martin butzke  the revolutionary guy catches the cutest and most conventional woman in the end  would you like to share a taxi with this guy kathrin von steinburg  she gave a stunning performance in tatort last year  her trancelike performance in this movie is no less  see her beautiful face and hear her dirty

last option you have is to be picky  some amount of time is spent with his friends  who's idea of fun is to rape a little year old  steal crappy tires off a piece of shit car for a dime sack of weed  and several other slightly retarded activities m's friend comesup with a plan to make  a piece and move to the us by running cocaine to miami  when the drug lord gives them a job  we're treated to an extremely lame scene of the three friends buying clothes at the mall with some music playing in the background  we see them trying different clothes on like little girls given  to shop  get there hair cut  and then strutting off looking like slick gangsters one character  carlos  will from this point on wear sunglasses always  even at night the day before they leave  the leader of the group leaves to speak with the drug lord  leaving m and his friend to be dumb  they party up  take several samples of the drugs they're suppose to run  and break into thier old school  acting like animals and smashing everything in sight the movie ends when m tries calling his girlfriend  who hangs up on him  the friends then proceed to set the pay phone on fire  which brings out a bunch of kids and some old man with gun  m and carlos' friend in charge of the drug run shows up on his motorcycle and wants them to leave with him now  then he takes off by himself  and gets shot by that old man  the police show up and arrest m and his friends but not the man who shot the guy and cover thier dead friend up with newspapers as music plays and it fades to credits  end spoiler i even watched this

just proves that there is no longer hope for video games becoming movies the plot  despite the fact that it obviously isn't supposed to matter  is the largest of many problems with the movie  the movie starts with what can only be described as five minutes of scrolling text that may or may not be important  as after a minute passes  the audience stops caring and just sits through the rest hitting the object closest to them  then there's something about an orphanage  some artefacts  an ancient tribe  some bureaucracy and some demons  all of which get so jumbled together that the viewers really can't follow with what is going on  characters move in and out of the plot like candy  some having huge buildups for meaningless deaths  basically  what i can understand is that some demons got released  and edward carnby  slater  has some link to them thanks to some operation given to children in his orphanage which has failed on him  he finds an artefact involving the demons and brings it to an exgirlfriend anthropologist  reid   who of course he manages to have sex with right away for no good reason  then  out of nowhere  all hell breaks loose  and the pair end up with a military team led by some asshole commander  dorff   who apparently has a mutual hatred for carnby it's all ridiculous  and the reason i don't really understand it isn't just because it's complicated and jumbled  but it leaves no room for anyone to really care  instead  i highly recommend that  if you must see this film  bring a tennis ball or something to occupy yourself when the plot manages to bore you into confusion the action scenes in a movie with a plot as terrible as this should at least bring it up a little  right  too bad  this movie is like any other ruined crap ever made  with enough quick cuts to behead a coop of chickens  considering that this is based on a horror game  not an action game  it is especially annoying the first action scene involving a man chasing cranby from a taxi is among the worst i have ever had to witness  and the rest isn't all that great either  the demons look somewhat cool  though the fact that they turn into powder when killed takes away all that effect  scenes involving lots of guns which should be cool to watch instead involve the muzzle fire as the only source of light and the camera zooming and panning faster than the head of a crack addict  it's all the kind of seizure inducing crap that keeps children in bed at night the acting is what i like to call taking actors and making them do nothing  slater does nothing but sound important for the whole movie  though he does seem to have more talent than he is letting on  the same is true of dorff  who gets a thankless role despite actually having some talent something that has happened to him a lot  reid is pretty much exactly what she should be  background sex appeal  as whenever she tries to act it is a disaster as is the incredibly bad scientist look she has in the beginning in all  this is the type of movie that worries me about future video game movies  if they keep ruining the spirit like this  it's only a matter of time before samus aran is killing middleeasterns with an ak and tommy vercetti is fighting a squadron of aliens  unlike resident evil  however  this one doesn't deserve a second chance  as i don't think anything could possibly help me forget just how terrible this movie

things  firstly it portrays prostitution as a career more akin to that of a dancer  you know with absolutely great friends  leg warmers lots of giggling  borrowing each others make up  you see in the reality of pretty woman the prostitute and this is a street walker prostitute we're talking about here  has a great life  she's healthy happy with only the occasional whimper to explain her predicament  my feeling is this 'happy hooker' type protagonist is a lot more palatable than an even nearly realistic character  which for me begs the question if you make a movie about a type of person but are too chicken scared to adorn that player with the characteristics familiar to that role then why do it  if i make a film about a chef but don't want him to cook or talk about food or wear a white hat then why make a film about a chef in the first place  by bailing out and turning the hooker into a respectable dancer type the story misses the point completely and consequently never indulges in any of the moral or social questions that it could have  what a cop out  really really lame  secondly  'pretty woman' insults romance itself  edward lewis played by richard gere has no clue how to seduce or romance this 'lady' that is without his plastic friend  yep don't leave home without it  especially if you are a moron in a suit who has no imagination  out of of his romantic moments involve splashing cash in one way or another  even when he first meets her it's the lotus esprit turbo that does all the work  necklaces here diamonds there limos over there  money money money

1,streisand fans only familiar with her work from the funny girl film onwards need to see this show to see what a brilliant performer streisand was  before she achieved her goal of becoming a movie star  there had never been a female singer quite like her ever before  and there never would be again sorry  celine  only in your dreams   but never again would streisand sing with the vibrancy  energy  and  above all  the enthusiasm and vulnerability with which she performs here  by the time she gets to that central park concert only or years later  she'd been filming funny girl in hollywood and her performing style has become less spontaneous and more reserved  more rehearsed and  let's face it  more angry  there's a wall between her and the audience  live performing was never what she really enjoyed  she did it because she knew it was her ticket to hollywood  and once she no longer had to do it she's done it as little as possible and oh  that legendary stage fright provides such a good excuse  her vocals here and on her earlier judy garland show appearance are incredible  streisand could truly make an old song sound new again  and composers such as richard rodgers and harold arlen loved her for it  but by the s streisand was trying to be a rock singer  her albums pandering to the younger audiences  with overwrought shrieking of songs that were unworthy of her effort or her voice  in the 's she came back with that brilliant broadway album  but went on and on about what a struggle it was to get it done  how they told her not to do it  etc  oh please  when has anyone told streisand what to do  she could have been doing good stuff like that all along  bringing audiences up to her level instead of stooping to what she thought the young public wanted  the back to broadway sequel wasn't nearly as good  as streisand seems to feel it necessary to improve on other composers' work  if he were alive at the time  would richard rodgers have even recognized his own some enchanted evening rodgers  notorious for taking singers to task for playing around with his melodies  would undoubtedly have been after streisand to sing what he'd written  she also blows michael crawford off the cd in their duet of music of the night  apparently reminding him just whose cd this is  why does she insist on taking songs that are duets and singing them by herself  and songs that aren't duets and singing them as duets with someone else who she then goes on to diminish supposedly judy garland took streisand aside and advised her  don't let them do to you what they did to me  advice streisand wasted no time in heeding  despite her protestations to the contrary  surely it looks like it's always been her way or the highway  just imagine  she told the cbs brass how her first tv special would be done  no guests  just her but nobody can argue with the results that are so evident here  treat yourself to this brilliant musical phenomenon before she was a legend  you'll be absolutely amazed at the difference ps  i watched this again last night    after not having seen it for many years  it was even better than i remembered  the st act begins with i'm late and includes make believe and how does the wine taste  and barbra's homage to childhood  i'm five  it climaxes as streisand appears with full and i mean full orchestra to sing people  she wasn't bored with the song yet and although it's a somewhat shorter rendition it really soars  compare it to some of her later autopilot versions  the nd act after streisand's kooky schtickpatter  which hasn't changed much over the years is the famous series of depression songs set amidst the extravagance of bergdorfgoodman's the rd act is the stunner  call it streisand  the orchestra  and the audience although we never see the audience that supposedly witness this historic event  with her fear of audiences and dislike of such performing  this may have been the toughest part for her  but if so  to her credit it doesn't show  she tears through lover come back to me and the torchy when the sun comes out though i can't remember in which order   the poignant why did i choose you  one of my alltime favorite streisand performances and offers a medley of funny girl songs  including of course don't rain on my parade and my favorite song from the score  the music that makes me dance explaining that fanny brice sang a song like that in and it made her the toast of broadway streisand then sings my man and it's almost a dressrehearsal template for her later screen rendition in the funny girl film the main difference being that the black gown here is sleeveless  her film gown had long sleeves and against the black background all we saw were her hands and face  but the vocal here is more urgent and charged than her later film vocal  her performance of the song has everything to do with streisand and nothing to do with fanny brice who  of course  never sang the song in such an allout manner as streisand does here or in the film  see the great ziegfield for a glimpse of brice's more understated version  the show ends with streisand singing happy days are here again over the credits when it was over i said to the friend i was watching it with  she has never  ever  done anything better and she was twentythree years old ,0.7576837539672852,0,streisand fans only familiar with her work from

diminish supposedly judy garland took streisand aside and advised her don't let them do to you what they did to me advice streisand wasted no time in heeding despite her protestations to the contrary surely it looks like it's always been her way or the highway just imagine she told the cbs brass how her first tv special would be done no guests just her but nobody can argue with the results that are so evident here treat yourself to this brilliant musical phenomenon before she was a legend you'll be absolutely amazed at the difference ps i watched this again last night after not having seen it for many years it was even better than i remembered the st act begins with i'm late and includes make believe and how does the wine taste and barbra's homage to childhood i'm five it climaxes as streisand appears with full and i mean full orchestra to sing people she wasn't bored with the song yet and although it's a somewhat shorter rendition it really soars compare it to some of her later autopilot versions the nd act after streisand's kooky schtickpatter which hasn't changed much over the years is the famous series of depression songs set amidst the extravagance of bergdorfgoodman's the rd act is the stunner call it streisand the orchestra and the audience although we never see the audience that supposedly witness this historic event with her fear of audiences and dislike of such performing this may have been the toughest part for her but if so to her credit it doesn't show she tears through lover come back to me and the torchy when the sun comes out though i can't remember in which order the poignant why did i choose you one of my alltime favorite streisand performances and offers a medley of funny girl songs including of course don't rain on my parade and my favorite song from the score the music that makes me dance explaining that fanny brice sang a song like that in and it made her the toast of broadway streisand then sings my man and it's almost a dressrehearsal template for her later screen rendition in the funny girl film the main difference being that the black gown here is sleeveless her film gown had long sleeves and against the black background all we saw were her hands and face but the vocal here is more urgent and charged than her later film vocal her performance of the song has everything to do with streisand and nothing to do with fanny brice who of course never sang the song in such an allout manner as streisand does here or in the film see the great ziegfield for a glimpse of brice's more understated version the show ends with streisand singing happy days are here again over the credits when it was over i said to the friend i was watching it with she has never ever done anything better and she was twentythree years

0,well  i can honestly say that this is the first time that i experienced a film that had literally no meat or potatoes in it  the entire film felt like it was just the salad with no main course  the

embarrassed for a concept in my entire life  i have never read the comics or seen the other programs with this character  but from the looks of the other reviews i am not off base with my observation to begin  the story moved too quickly  for someone new to this character and situations  i needed more built into creating the reasons instead of finding the solution  i have seen other anime if you could call this one an anime that do great things with their characters because they take the time to develop them  there was nothing set aside for lady death  in a few short scenes  we see her train with cremator and instantly become this aggressive shebeast of hell  this was hard for me to swallow  considering moments before she was introduced as this weak and feeble woman controlled by her father  suddenly  she is immersed with hatred and can do battle with an existence that has been around for millions of years  this was absurd  the presentation of lady death was poor  to say the least  i felt as if she was nothing more than an animated character instead of a desperate woman with revenge on the mind  for me  it just didn't work  she was nothing more than eyecandy for prepubescent boys wanting to ogle the mass quantities of skin that she suddenly grew on her chest when training with cremator  oh  i felt sick just watching her  the same goes for the character of cremator  who was this random person  the explanation they gave wasn't enough  and instead i was left with more incoherent babbling than actual development  it is a very sad day in hell when we forgo characters to show more violence and action  especially in an animated feature next  there was lucifer himself  let me just say that i think i could do battle with the king of hell and survive  he was weak  his voice was laughable  and he just didn't represent the image that i had in my mind  it was as if disney was in control and wanted to make him semipc  he lacked the darkness and corrupt nature that lucifer embodies  he was not the ruler of hell  but instead just a lackey that had a bigger place to live  speaking of living or dying  how can you die again in hell  that was a concept that definitely needed more explanation  most of the characters were worrying about dying  when they didn't even consider the option that they were already dead  that is how they got to hell  i think it was this level of thinking that ruined the film for me  i didn't quite capture the notion that your soul was still in a solid body in hell  but that could just be me or maybe it was because there was no development in this story  there was nothing built  just preparing the battle sequences were hysterically bad  the animation in this cartoon felt like it was made in the early s  there was nothing impressive about the way that this film was drawn  why are we  america  so behind on animation  it is huge in asia  and it is creeping in hardcore here because we keep making films like lady death that do not challenge or use any part of imagination  we are cheap  and this film shows it overall  this film was bad  the animation coupled with the horrendous voice work was cheap  i had head somewhere that this film as in production for a long time  which is hard to understand because i think i could have made this film on my credit card  the production was horrendous as well as the story  nothing was developed  leaving huge gaping plot holes that nearly everyone fell into  the strength of the characters was missing  and nothing was explained  i wasted my time with this one and would

obsessed with bats and insists they go to a nearby cave  once there  they behave very  very  very stupidly hallmark of a bad film and are soon bitten by a bat  according to this film  bats love to attack people and there are vampire bats in the usboth of which are not true at all oddly  after being bitten  the man doesn't even bother going to the hospital  the first thing on anyone's mind especially a doctor is to get medical help immediately  but not this boob  soon  he's having seizuresyet he still isn't interested in seeking help  again and again you keep thinking that this must be the stupidest couple in film history  after a while  he eventually goes to see a doctor and is sent to the hospital  but  by then it's too late and his attacks become more violent and he begins killing people to suck their blood  when it's totally obvious to everyone that the man is a crazed killing machine  the wife who  like her husband  has a grapefruit for a brain refuses to believe he's dangerouseven after he attacks people  steals an ambulance and runs a police car off the road  now most of the time moss is going through these episodes  his eyes roll back and he looks like a normal person  oddly  however  a couple times he develops batlike hands and towards the end they used some nice prosthetics on him to make him look quite batlike  had this been really cheesy  the film would have merited a in the very end  in a twist that hardly made any sense at all  the wife inexplicably turned into a crazed bat lady and had a swarm of bats kill the evil sheriff  how all this was arranged was a mystery as was moss' and mcandrew's belief that this film would somehow help their careersthough they both have had reasonably long careers on tv playing bit roles since overall  very dumb  the plot is silly and makes no sense and strongly relies on people acting way too dumb to be real  not a good film at all  but not among the worst films of all time either note  for some reason
