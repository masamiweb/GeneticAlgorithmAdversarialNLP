0,first of all  this film is glacially slowmoving  and i can see most viewers losing patience with it altogether in the first thirty minutes the film's subject matter was one i think would form the basis of an excellent film  what was most lacking here was a plot that would advance the underlying themes it's unfortunate  because in the hands of a writer like  say  lanford wilson  i think symbolism like a mountainlion invading a school campus could take on great  tragic proportions without being heavyhanded i think  with a good script supporting the film  the same filmmaker  with the same tastes  and even with the same actors who didn't really even get a chance to impress me  might have been able to present a meaningful and touching depiction of the pains and struggles that a boy goes through when he develops a powerful crush on an older boy that he admires however  i'm sorry to say that without this foundation  and armed with a vague  dullwitted  and vastly uninteresting script  without any sort of plot in sight  and lacking any sort of sensible structure for example  after viewing it  i believe you will find that you cannot point to climactic scenes  and instead  will find yourself enumerating well  maybe that scene  or that one  were climaxes  the result is minutes of tedium without a good plot  we never get terribly interested in any of the characters  their trials and difficulties are simply dull and boring without a good plot  dramatic devices and surrealistic directorial liberties become puzzling and confusing rather than enhancements to the storyline  i never really could believe  for example  the creation of leah and i think that most viewers would be utterly baffled by the conventional way in which her telephone calls were filmed as the film stands  i'm afraid it's one i cannot recommend at all  what i can never understand is why a film like this one isn't remade by an enterprising filmmaker  instead of all the mediocre remakes of films that were superlatively good in the first release  all it needs is a good script  written by good writers  and i think this film could be easily turned into an unforgettable classic about an aspect of male comingofage that is rarely treated in drama  all the elements that were so tedious and seemed so recherche in the film the messages written on the boy's belly  the leah scenes  the televisionscreen fantasies could become rich if underpinned with a good storyline i see in quite a few comments that people are talking of this film as somehow being about a gay subject  and i think that's mistaken  obviously  the crush depicted is that of a newly pubescent boy on an older adolescent boy  but the character of logan is far too young to have settled on any particular sexual choices  and  indeed  in his depicted masturbation fantasies  we see all sorts of stimuli  sexual and nonsexual  as we would expect in a very young boy like him  i believe crushes such as logan's are common among male youths who grow up to have a decided preference for female sexpartners ,0.008310282602906227,1,first of all this film is glacially slowmoving and i can see most viewers losing patience with

everyone is attempting to commit adultery everyone is trying to cheat someone that or they are being knifed cuckolded or swindled nobody is cheerful nobody laughs nobody has a blinding stroke of chance or a really delightful day it's hell with cockney accents i suspect this programme must be sponsored by the equates it's perfect viewing for the depressed it doesn't cheer them up what it does do is introduces a totality community of such bedridden despondent sadarses that viewers are moved to believe their many really could be worse they might be vie in 'albert square'apart from the above as a representation of london's east end it is pure hokum the programmemakers have obviously never been across town the first thing you encounter on the mile ending paths is a colossal mosque and this prettywell defines the racial majority of the population bianco british londoners are a dispersed and rapidly diminishing minority a big advertisement hoarding presently near the bow road catwalk and sponsored by tower hamlets health empathetic boasts that 'eight out of ten members of the community can now seeing their doctor more quickly' dix healthy smiling faces beam down at the observer in confirmation sixth of them are darkskinned what's more i used to work with a bunch of anglosaxon dare i say 'pukka' cockneys a few years ago and i can tell you that a more obnoxiously ethnic experience i've never had each day was loves an oswald moseley rally they couldn't passage mins not denigrating some other race or nationalities than their own and in phrases that were repulsive and obscene 'fackin' pakis' and 'fackin' maceroons' were the small change of conversation in fact their entire and extremely limited stock of adjectives fixated upon sexorgans and their application alf garnett was a models of liberal virtue in comparison any programme that purported to represent london's native eastend caucasians in their true nature would be completely inappropriate for broadcast even after the oclock watershed imagine a ku klux lynching script written by quentin tarantino and you'd be somewhere near the mark but when they weren't being stubborn bigots they were at less supremely cheerful i don't know how such a soapopera came to be this imaginary castaway island of white misery has absolutely no mindful upon real culture whatsoever and if you're of a comparatively sanguine disposition it will quick reduce you to rip of sorrow comparatively ordinary agents pretending to be comparatively usual chronicdepressives with cockney accents what's the point of that dull dreary unrelentingly disillusional and ethnically preposterous the most trendy programme of an apparently diseased and dying nations avoid it like the

1,streisand fans only familiar with her work from the funny girl film onwards need to see this show to see what a brilliant performer streisand was  before she achieved her goal of becoming a movie star  there had never been a female singer quite like her ever before  and there never would be again sorry  celine  only in your dreams   but never again would streisand sing with the vibrancy  energy  and  above all  the enthusiasm and vulnerability with which she performs here  by the time she gets to that central park concert only or years later  she'd been filming funny girl in hollywood and her performing style has become less spontaneous and more reserved  more rehearsed and  let's face it  more angry  there's a wall between her and the audience  live performing was never what she really enjoyed  she did it because she knew it was her ticket to hollywood  and once she no longer had to do it she's done it as little as possible and oh  that legendary stage fright provides such a good excuse  her vocals here and on her earlier judy garland show appearance are incredible  streisand could truly make an old song sound new again  and composers such as richard rodgers and harold arlen loved her for it  but by the s streisand was trying to be a rock singer  her albums pandering to the younger audiences  with overwrought shrieking of songs that were unworthy of her effort or her voice  in the 's she came back with that brilliant broadway album  but went on and on about what a struggle it was to get it done  how they told her not to do it  etc  oh please  when has anyone told streisand what to do  she could have been doing good stuff like that all along  bringing audiences up to her level instead of stooping to what she thought the young public wanted  the back to broadway sequel wasn't nearly as good  as streisand seems to feel it necessary to improve on other composers' work  if he were alive at the time  would richard rodgers have even recognized his own some enchanted evening rodgers  notorious for taking singers to task for playing around with his melodies  would undoubtedly have been after streisand to sing what he'd written  she also blows michael crawford off the cd in their duet of music of the night  apparently reminding him just whose cd this is  why does she insist on taking songs that are duets and singing them by herself  and songs that aren't duets and singing them as duets with someone else who she then goes on to diminish supposedly judy garland took streisand aside and advised her  don't let them do to you what they did to me  advice streisand wasted no time in heeding  despite her protestations to the contrary  surely it looks like it's always been her way or the highway  just imagine  she told the cbs brass how her first tv special would be done  no guests  just her but nobody can argue with the results that are so evident here  treat yourself to this brilliant musical phenomenon before she was a legend  you'll be absolutely amazed at the difference ps  i watched this again last night    after not having seen it for many years  it was even better than i remembered  the st act begins with i'm late and includes make believe and how does the wine taste  and barbra's homage to childhood  i'm five  it climaxes as streisand appears with full and i mean full orchestra to sing people  she wasn't bored with the song yet and although it's a somewhat shorter rendition it really soars  compare it to some of her later autopilot versions  the nd act after streisand's kooky schtickpatter  which hasn't changed much over the years is the famous series of depression songs set amidst the extravagance of bergdorfgoodman's the rd act is the stunner  call it streisand  the orchestra  and the audience although we never see the audience that supposedly witness this historic event  with her fear of audiences and dislike of such performing  this may have been the toughest part for her  but if so  to her credit it doesn't show  she tears through lover come back to me and the torchy when the sun comes out though i can't remember in which order   the poignant why did i choose you  one of my alltime favorite streisand performances and offers a medley of funny girl songs  including of course don't rain on my parade and my favorite song from the score  the music that makes me dance explaining that fanny brice sang a song like that in and it made her the toast of broadway streisand then sings my man and it's almost a dressrehearsal template for her later screen rendition in the funny girl film the main difference being that the black gown here is sleeveless  her film gown had long sleeves and against the black background all we saw were her hands and face  but the vocal here is more urgent and charged than her later film vocal  her performance of the song has everything to do with streisand and nothing to do with fanny brice who  of course  never sang the song in such an allout manner as streisand does here or in the film  see the great ziegfield for a glimpse of brice's more understated version  the show ends with streisand singing happy days are here again over the credits when it

prowess  if the mechanics of movie making are what make a picture great  then yes  road to perdition is a distant cousin to the godfather in terms of what it achieves in cinematography  editing  music scoring and sound  what it doesn't have is a resonance that all great stories and some very rare movies have that stay with the viewer long after the experience of reading or seeing it is over  as with american beauty  there is a cold  distancing feel to this movie  despite some very tense scenes involving paternal love  loyalty and betrayal this story of a hit man tom hanks and his relationship to a surrogate father  figure who is also his boss  an elderly irish mob leader paul newman  seems to have been culled from innumerable gangster movies of years past  the father  son motif that hangs over this picture is so heavy handed in its treatment that there is not much room for spontaneity  the entire enterprise has been very carefully wrought  and nearly all the dialog is delivered with an air of great portent  this is obviously a gangster film  hence the requisite amount of violence and bloodshed  but the film is nearly devoid of any humor to speak of  only in scenes involving a young boy driving a getaway car in a cunningly edited montage is there any sense of lightheartedness to leaven the pervasive sense of doom that being said  i have nothing but the highest praise for the stunning look of this film  indeed  it is not an overstatement to say that this is one of the most beautifully photographed and designed movies i have ever seen  veteran cameraman conrad hall will very likely win another oscar for his work here  the production 's sets and costumes are just as exemplary  in fact  the entire film is a technical marvel  mr  mendes continues to astonish with his vivid use of color  and he and mr  hall again make very dramatic use of red blood splattered against pale colored walls  all the more effective and disconcerting due to the preponderance of blacks  blues and grays that dominate the movie's color scheme if i have failed to duly note the acting  it is not because the actors do not purport themselves ably  everyone in the film is top notch  with special mention going to the two malevolent bad guys  daniel craig is the classic man you love to hate the spoiled  impulsive son of newman's gangster father  and an almost unrecognizable jude law as an especially slimy miscreant who goes on pursuit of hanks and his son and figures very importantly in the film's riveting second half  but acting in a movie this dazzling

sincerely  then it's actually possible for the film to work  for example  when you watch freddy got fingered as a traditional grossout comedy  it's complete and utter garbage  when you watch it with the understanding that it's actually a neosurrealist comedy  it's brilliant it works with good movies too  if jaws hadn't accepted the reality it created  the airtank explosion ending wouldn't have worked  but  a lot of people think jaws is vastly overrated for this type of reason  and they aren't wrong  but it has it's strengths  doesn't it  the point being that a movie like this makes sense if you look at it with the right perspective  some people  like me  get it right away  while others never will no matter how often it's explained  jim jarmusch made a compelling defense of showgirls once  and even afterwards i still can't see it from his p o v  doesn't mean he's wrong though  if you have the right frame of mind when you watch this movie and no i do not mean stoned  i'm gonna put that to bed right now  you can actually enjoy the movie for the dumb  cheap  pointless slapstick lates  earlysstyle farce that it is the defenders and haters of this film are right  it's stupid  and that's the point  the movie accepts the stupidity of the characters much in the same way the jerk accepted navin johnson's idiocy  and because it takes that and runs with it  the movie focuses exclusively on using that to forward the plot and to define the characters  a bad movie would actually do this and fail to use that logic properly  bad movie are bad because they make it up as they go along  whereas movies like the stupids knows where it's going  what it's doing and why from the beginning i can't defend the film from an artistic standpoint  which is why i give it such a low rating  the acting is mostly bad  the jokes very superficial  and the liveaction quality probably ruins what would have worked as a cartoon  but i can't deny that it is entertaining in its own way  and that's why i defend it  i got it right away  and i pity those who don't i'll admit i was drawn to this movie because of christopher lee's delicious cameo appearance hearing him say release the drive bee  would have been worth the rental price even if i hated this film  but was amazed to find that  aside from the tv studio applause sign segment with jenny mccarthy  i was never bored  and never disappointed  in fact  many of the jokes  because of their cartoonish context  were hilarious in particular the airbagcigarette explosion  they were dumb  but they were funny  and the movie doesn't pretend to be anything else  a stupid comedy about stupid characters and instead of apologizing for it  it enjoys itself and that's exactly why it works ,0.17181655764579773,1,this is probably the only film i've seen where

still got blasted  even when ogilvy and company get fried by the martians' 'heat ray'   they flounce and mince in some weird kind of dance  even when they're theoretically dead and reduced to

journey unfolds  o'hara finds that bannister and grisby are not pleasant to be around  and more so with grisby  who at first seems out of his gourd  yet as the plot unfolds  o'hara is drawn into a scam that grisby is planning for insurance money  with results that i dare not reveal although they have been discussed over and over by others whatever liabilities pop up here and there in the mystery part of the story and those few noticeable moments where shots were studio dictated  the performances and the look of the film are what remains striking after over fiftyfive years  though he

this would be the breath of fresh air  the halestorm movie i could finally discuss with my nonmormon friends boy  was i wrong i figured  since this had blist talent like clint howard  gary coleman  andrew wilson  and fred willard one of my favorites  this would have to be at least a little funny  and besides  church basketball is ripe with potential for plenty of hilarious gags and such  but i must say  throughout the entire movie  it seemed as though no one knew what they were doing  every joke fell flat  and every opportunity for a genuinely funny gag went ignored  the dialogue was bland  and the film had some of the worst character development i have ever seen  every single character but wilson's was less than onedimensional  it's hard to believe that after nine rewrites the film was still as mindnumbingly stale as the train wreck i witnessed  i can't put into words the rage i felt sitting through this  my friends and i were extras in the final game scene  so we went to the premiere in washington city  ut  kurt hale  the director  was there  and i must say  i avoided all contact with him after the show  he waited at the door  seemingly ready for feedback  i couldn't bring myself to tell him that his film not only ripped away a good hour and a half of my life  but it left a nasty  painful scar that i will never forget here are a few specific problems i ha there was a minor love story subplot between the janitor and the chubby piano player  but these two characters came out of nowhere  and were impossible to care about  so my friends and i were left constantly wondering why we were supposed to care about these two lame  uninteresting characters  there were many subplots that popped up every now and then  each promising the audience the chance for laughs  but each one came and went in a puff of smoke  ending before you could even start caring  this was pretty much how the whole movie felt this film was a major letdown  and i feel bad for everyone who's expecting the first real funny mormon movie  true  the jokes in this one aren't too exclusive to mormons  then again  it's hard to tell what was a joke and what was a loud ringing

overall disposition has changed  and it falls into almost all of the pitfalls that plague bad anime  seven or eight friends and myself started watching this series on tv  by the end  only one friend and i were still watching and neither of us liked it allow me to explain the plot for you  you can skip this paragraph if you don't want to know  kagome is an average high school student  who one day falls into a magical well near her family run shrine  when kagome comes out of the well again  she has been transported back in time to the feudal era of japan  she meets up with many other characters and they form a group of five or so companions who set off on a journey of revenge  justice  groping in one characters case  overall  they are trying to recover the pieces of the sacred jewel shard which enhances the power of demons who use it while there are many  many side stories and story arcs  there is no were near enough material to occupy episodes  the only story arc that is interesting enough to watch is still sort of dull the band of seven  after the half way mark in the series or maybe even before  it becomes painfully obvious that the plot is frozen in place and whoever made the series decided instead to put in dozens and dozens of filler episodes  these episodes have little to no impact on the story  and rarely even on the characters  in some cases  some characters who had an important role in the story will disappear for dozens of episodes at a time  many episodes follow the exact same cookie cutter patterns as the stories before it  inuyasha shoots windscar at enemy  windscar deflects  characters gasp in horror  enemy turns out to have barrier  characters spent three episodes trying to kill enemy before kagome finally fires sacred arrow at him and he turns to dust  also major spoiler  the conclusion will be revealed the lack of any conclusion makes it seem like you have waisted hours  major spoiler overthe animation itself is above average  and in some cases excellent  even so  reused animation cells plague most action scenes  and it is very hard to ignore them when it is clear that the exact same boulder has flown past a character five or six times in a row on the brighter side however  all of the characters are very well developed and the romances between some of the characters were truly captivating  also  the character designs  appearences  were brilliant and at times among the best i have seen  particularly with the band of seven  there is definitely no shortage of cosplay opportunities here  even so  i found myself hoping that a character would die just so there would be some sort of movement in the plot  and some of the humour in the show between characters is used again and again  one particular joke sit boy is found within the first five episodes  and you can literally expect it to be used again and again for the remaining episodes although there are some good aspects of the show and it is easy to see why it has a huge following  the series seems to be dominated by obsessed fan girls who drool over sesshomiru and inuyasha bottom line  definitely worth checking out  but not worth watching the whole series  the first episodes are very clever  original and enjoyable for anybody  but after that  it simply becomes dull and tedious  watching a tv show should never feel like a chore  but somehow this series accomplishes just

1,bill crain's rarer than rare 'slasher' movie certainly doesn't follow the standard stalk and slash guidelines that have become so essential of its counterparts  the bogeyman this time around uses grenades and small arms as well as an awesome array of melee weapons   a sin that's virtually unacceptable in most posthalloween genre pieces  but there's still just enough familiarity to keep slasher buffs from checking the rule book and the plot never strays too far from the path that you've grown to expect  just as wally koz's surprisingly decent was seemingly put together with help from various members of his family  mirage seems to have been a joint production from relatives of the director  looking through the credits i noticed numerous 'crains' listed in key positions throughout the construction of the feature  but despite fairly good distribution across the globe  the movie failed to make an impression either side of the atlantic and now it has become pretty much a phantom of the vhs market  nevertheless this only made it appeal to me even more and so i strained my resources to track a copy down it all takes place in the middle of the dessert  which as i'm sure you'll agree is hardly the most exciting location  with that said though  i must admit that there's certainly going to be no chance of any nosey john q laws turning up unexpectedly  four undeniably beautiful youngsters head out into the sand for a night of debauchery and frolics that always seems to rub homicidal maniacs the wrong way  chris jennifer mcallister and her boyfriend greg kenny johnson meet up with amusing new age hippies trip kevin mcparland and mary nicole anton at a make shift camp site in the midst of the dunelike wilderness  greg's older brother kyle todd schaefer and his buxom girlfriend bambi laura albert soon turn up to join the body count applicants in their quest for an early grave  kyle used to date chris before his younger brother took the liberty of stealing his squeeze  something that kyle doesn't seem too keen to forget  sound like a motive for a massacre  well what did you expect  before long an unseen someone driving a truck with tinted windows joins the gathering with a unique set of tricks up his sleeve  will any of the kids survive to turn up for a sequel  i have had trouble tracking down any information at all about this feature  i don't even know if director bill crain is aka william crain  the man behind midnight fear and blacula among others  mirage certainly doesn't appear on his official filmography  so your guess is as good as mine  judging by the credible work behind the camera  i'd have to say that i find it hard to believe that this is the debut of a man with no previous cinematic experience  the film is stylishly photographed with some superb work from dp michael crain  and the director boasts a credible talent for building suspense when it's necessary  r  christopher biggs' gore fx are imaginatively created and gruesome  and kudos to the sleepy head over at the bbfc who inexplicably let this pass through uncut on a usually stringent rating  a couple of the murders are indeed extremely macabre  one guy gets buried up to his neck in sand before coming face to face with a grenade  while another ends up literally legless after loosing a battle with a chain and a pick up truck  there's also some black humor that's surely unintentional  we spend the majority of the feature seeing only the killer's boots as he steps out of his vehicle and stalks the youngsters  but when he's revealed to hilariously resemble keanu reeves circa bill and ted's bogus journey  i didn't quite know what to expect  thankfully crain knows exactly how to keep things creepy and the showdown is particularly mean spirited as the psycho taunts chris sadistically there are some surprisingly good performances on display from an extremely inexperienced cast  the divine jennifer mcallister does a superb job as the heroine and b g  steers portrays off his rocker dementia with finesse  the casting director chose wisely to pick some of the most beautiful females ever slaughtered in slasher cinema and it gratefully doesn't come at the cost of thespian potential  the soundtrack works well to build the desolate atmosphere of isolation  which is carefully handled by a director that should have been signed and nurtured by hollywood bigwigs  watch out for the superb nightmare sequence that is truly horror filmmaking at it's freakiest mirage is a good late entry to the cycle that was somewhat unfortunate to miss a boom year placing amongst the slasher elite  when you consider that this was made with just a cast of seven and a pick up truck  you have to say that they did a damn good job  the flaws are numerous  but never

stalk and slash guidelines that have become so essential of its counterparts the bogeyman this time around uses grenades and small arms as well as an awesome array of melee weapons a sin that's virtually unacceptable in most posthalloween genre pieces but there's still just enough familiarity to keep melodramas buffs from checking the rule book and the plot never strays too far from the path that you've grown to expect just as wally koz's surprisingly decent was seemingly put together with help from various members of his family mirage seems to have been a joint production from relatives of the director looking through the credits i noticed numerous 'crains' listed in key positions throughout the architectural of the feature but despite fairly good distribution across the globe the movie failed to make an impression either side of the atlantic and now it has become pretty much a phantom of the vhs market nevertheless this only made it appeal to me even more and so i strained my resources to track a copy down it all takes place in the middle of the dessert which as i'm sure you'll agree is hardly the most exciting location with that said though i must admit that there's certainly going to be no chance of any nosey john q laws turning up unexpectedly four undeniably beautiful youngsters head out into the sand for a night of debauchery and frolics that always seems to rub mortal maniacs the wrong way chris jennifer mcallister and her boyfriend greg kenny johnson meet up with amusing novel ageing hippies trip kevin mcparland and mary nicole anton at a make shift camp site in the midst of the dunelike wilderness greg's older brother kyle todd schaefer and his buxom girlfriend bambi laura albert soon turn up to join the body count applicants in their quest for an early grave kyle used to date chris before his younger brother took the liberty of stealing his squeeze  something that kyle doesn't seem too keen to forget sound fond a motive for a massacre well what did you expect before long an stealth someone driving a truck with tinted windows joins the gathering with a unique set of tricks up his sleeve will any of the kids survive to turn up for a sequel i have had trouble tracking down any information at all about this feature i don't even know if director bill crain is aka william crain  the man behind midnight fear and blacula among others fallacy certainly doesn't appear on his official filmography so your guess is as good as mine judging by the credible work behind the camera i'd have to say that i find it hard to believe that this is the debut of a man with no previous cinematic experience the film is stylish photographed with some superb work from dp michael crain and the director boasts a credible talent for building suspense when it's necessary r christopher biggs' gore fx are imaginatively created and gruesome and kudos to the sleepy head over at the bbfc who inexplicably let this pass through uncut on a usually stringent rating a couple of the assassinate are indeed extremely macabre one guy gets buried up to his neck in sand before coming face to face with a grenade while another ends up literally legless after loosing a battle with a chain and a pick up truck there's also some black humor that's surely unintentional we spend the majority of the feature seeing only the killer's boots as he steps out of his vehicle and stalks the youngsters but when he's revealed to hilariously resemble keanu hawkins circa bill and ted's bogus journey i didn't quite know what to expect thankfully crain knows exactly how to keep things creepy and the showdown is particularly mean spirited as the psycho taunts chris sadistically there are some surprisingly good performances on display from an extremely inexperienced cast the divine jennifer mcallister does a superb job as the heroine and b g steers portrays off his rocker dementia with finesse the casting director chose wisely to pick some of the most beautiful daughters ever slaughtered in slasher cinema and it gratefully doesn't come at the cost of thespian potential the soundtrack works well to build the desolate atmosphere of isolation which is carefully handled by a director that should have been signed and nurtured by hollywood bigwigs watch out for the superb nightmare sequence that is truly horror filmmaking at it's freakiest mirage is a good late entry to the cycle that was somewhat unfortunate to miss a boom year placing amongst the slasher elite when you consider that this was made with just a cast of seven and a pick up truck you have to say that they did a damn good job the flaws are myriad but never derail credibility from the net result unfortunately you've probably got more chance of finding liquid gold in your coffee mug than you have of ever tracking down a copy if you see this one covered in dust on the top shelf of your local video store then make sure you pick it up

be genius  the premise seemed far too silly and stupid for anything good to come out of it  but at the back of my mind i was thinking but there must be something good about it for uma thurman and luke wilson do to the film   not that i think either of them are particularly terrific but they are bignamed stars who would normally only do films that would enhance their reputations  however  about minutes into the feature i realized that the movie was probably worse than i had at first anticipated  i was shocked at how terrible the script was  it really gave the actors nothing to work with  so much so that they really looked like they didn't know what they were doing especially luke wilson  the story was completely predictable  if you've seen the ad then you've pretty much seen the movie  and there was nothing original about it  it pretty much borrows from every 'superhero' story that has ever been which would be acceptable had the film been set up as a satire of that genre  but alas it wasn't  the direction seemed to be of realism  i got the feeling that the director wanted the film to feel completely realistic and not satire at all  and yet there were some moments in the film that were so unbelievably unrealistic that it would have worked if it were a satire  at one moment in the movie two of the characters seem to die and one of the surviving characters has a line like oh well  she's dead  time to move on and he says it in such a droll voice that it completely didn't make any sense  i found myself checking my watch after about minutes to see how much longer i would have to sit through it  and then it struck me  i began to think i wonder if the studio have made this picture as a test to see if they can make the worst possible movie ever made  and still pull a large audience   i couldn't think of any other reason why this film would be made  for movies to be made these days  the script goes to a massive screening process and very very few scripts actually make it to the production stage  i can't comprehend how this one got past the first draft stage  by the end  and exceedingly  dumbfoundingly stupid climax  i was laughing heartily  just not at what the filmmakers wanted me to laugh at  but instead at how ridiculous and stupid the movie was  thank god i didn't have to pay money to see it  because that would have really annoyed me  oh  and could i just add  that of the two wilson brothers  i have always preferred luke because i think he is a better  more versatile actor  but if he wants to step even further into owen's shadow then this is exactly the way to do it  i doubt that he will get many more job offers after this crappy waste of hours  and remember  it only got a generous  because i couldn't select ,0.013566590845584871,1,first

from the set decoration  through wardrobe and plot  to the performances and direction  take the character of ernie kovacks  he's referred to as a drunk and a nut  and here's how the movie demonstrates these traits  he asks for a second drink  and  though he always wears a jacket and tie like the other gentlemen  his hair is a bit long and tousled  that's a strictly s version of a drunk and a nut  nothing is out of place  everything is tidy and free of dust  the soles of jimmy stewart's shoes are barely scuffed and the zodiac club  where the witches hang out  it's called a low dive  yet it's a clean  dark place with polite waiters  a quintet of musicians  neatly dressed clientèle  and potted plants against bare brick walls  that is not my idea or yours of a low dive  not even for greenwich village in my idea of a dive in greenwich village is julius's or the white horse tavern or the san remo or the swing rendezvous  a now defunct lesbian hangout  the zodiac club is a high dive compared to these the kookiness we always hear about is muted by today's standards  i mean  kim novak is odd because she runs around her apartment in her bare feet  and she wears a lot of black clothes like the beatniks of the period did but never mind all that  it's an enjoyable romantic comedy  kim novak is effective as gillian  who runs a primitive art shop for the uptrodden  she has a strange beauty  bulky and ethereal at the same time  she glides rather than walks  a wispy presence  her eyebrows seem drawn with a set of plastic french curves  and jimmy stewart is quite good as the bewildered and bewitched victim  in the s he usually played in light roles  in the postwar years and for much of the s he was the tortured protagonist  but here he puts his early experience in comedy to good use  who could resist laughing when hermione gingold forces him to wear a shawl and drink a hideous concoction of putrid fluid in order to cure him of novak's spell  it's good to see him as a stooge instead of the angry and indignant man of principle he was in danger of becoming  richard quine directs the movie quietly  without fireworks or special effects  and does some interesting things that the play couldn't have had  note the scene in which novak casts the spell over stewart  when the siamese cat's face and ears seem to merge with novak's startling eyes ernie kovacks in the s was a

indescribable tricks in an unpopulated room with only bartok's concerto for orchestra as background  and he did an unimpeachable sketch using the character of percy dovetail  an effete poet  the credits kind of skip over the condoli brothers but that's rather casual because these two guys  pete and conte  were virtuoso trumpeters with independent careers in jazz ensembles  conte was later a member of doc severison's band on johnny carson's late show the third act kind of bogs down a little and becomes more romantic than comedy but it's never dull  the whole film rolls along as neatly as

seem to be something one would find on a canvas  framed and hung in a museum or on the walls of an eccentric's home  the costumes were gorgeous and  despite not being the most comfortable clothes in the world  made me want to find a seamstress to create such garb for myself  the whole movie was set on the picturesque lake geneva where i hope to one day go because of seeing this movie and the serenity that these historical figures found there this movie shows  besides the tranquility found by all the escapees of england's harsh judgements  the strangeness that surrounded this adventure as well  yes  there were drugs  it was a fairly common practice during that time  a time when drugs were not illegal  and the taking of laudanum the liquid form of opium was medicinal as well as recreational  shelley suffered from consumption  lord byron suffered the pains of a clubbed foot  it was not surprising that there would be prescriptions of the strong drugs that were in their

essence of the summer  as i've read about it  this movie was based on a wonderful book haunted summer by anne edwards  if you like this movie  read the book  the author takes the story from what she was able to put together from the actual journals of mary godwin shelley and the other participants of this story if you are a person who loves history even the little inaccuracies from time to time

1,few would argue that master animation director hayao miyazaki is one of the few to hold this ability no  too many are focused on john lassiter's amazing ability to steal other movies plots  turn them into pretty puppet shows and then be lauded as a genius    but i digress miyazaki has given us film after film that deals with important mature issues usually ecologically themed  and has an intelligent script that even the most jaded viewer who would normally despise any film that was animated could thoroughly enjoy if given the chance  still  miyazaki  almost  never forgets who will undoubtedly be in the audience of these movies children that said  i am at a loss to think of another filmmaker with this ability  where else are you going to have a film where a three year old my nephew link will sit still throughout the move  enthralled  a year old my niece amber loving it all her own and able to appreciate the star power of frankie jonas and noah cyrus  a year old my nephew aaron who's review was of course it was good  everything miyazakisan does is good  a year old animation fan brought to tears by the powerful directing and gorgeous animation er  that would be me  and a year old woman my mother able to connect with the mother characters and i'm betting the older charas too and loving the cuteness of the child characters and that is what i respect most about miyazakisan  he seems to speak to his audience in a completely different way than the average filmmaker  on the surface  ponyo could be seen as a simple story about a little fishgirl who gets a taste of the human world and wants to join it and the friend she makes there  a little boy names soske somewhat like the little mermaid  but there is an entire different level at play here  true to form  miyazaki populates his film with intensely strong female characters ponyo's mother  soske's mother  the older ladies in a nursing home are all genuine characters with minds of their own and extremely strong willed but the girl who takes the cake is ponyo herself  once she decides that she likes the human world  she simply uses her own will to achieve her dreams  her father is trying to keep her innocent  and keep her a magical fish  but young ponyo knows what she wants and becomes human out of simply her own determination  once human  she teams up with her friend  soske  whom she loves very much although maybe not as much as ham  soske is asked to be the man of the house at age five when his mother lisa decides she has to help the people at the rest home where she works during a typhoon that has been inadvertently caused by ponyo on her quest to become human  frankie jonas yes  he's related to the jonas brothers  can we just get past that please  gives  perhaps  the best performance in the film as young soske which is good since he has the most lines  his character is also strong willed  but also very respectful and friendly characteristics you're not likely to find in a child character on this side of the pacific in the end  ponyo's father  fujimoto must cope with his daughter's decision and his estranges wife's wishes to allow her to be human  he hopes that ponyo and soske will remember him fondly  and once again  miyazaki refuses to allow a character to become the stereotypical bad guy  although miyazaki has for some reason received some criticism for this  it is  honestly  what makes his movies magical and yet relatable  no one in real life is completely a bad person  all humans are various shades of gray  and that is exactly what miyazaki does with his characters  and then there's the animation itself  in a time when cgi would certainly have helped with the copious amounts of effects shots in this film  especially the water  miyazaki has chosen to incorporate no cgi whatsoever  certainly the hand drawn animation was colored by digital means  but every film in this was handdrawn and i  for one  was extremely grateful for that  the character animation was extremely fluid  and there even appeared to be some lipsync going on quite unusual for an anime film  the backgrounds seemed to be rendered with colored pencil and had an effect all its own on the audience  this is what animation used to look like and what it should look like  in the end  i found ponyo to be thoroughly enjoyable  certainly not miyazaki's best in my opinion  that honor is still held by kiki's delivery service  but still a star fun movie for the entire family ,0.9842775464057922,0,few would argue that master animation director hayao miyazaki is eden of the few

0,this movie starts out promisingly  with an early scene in which frank morgan advises against gary cooper's marriage to his daughter  anita louise  frank morgan  playing an unabashed golddigger  loudly complains to cooper about his perceived penury at the hands of his family  including his daughter  anita louise  i am a fan of all actors  frank morgan is to my mind a hollywood treasure  cooper a legend  and louise a very lovely  versatile and underappreciated actress seldom seen in the leading role  i also have nothing against teresa wright  and while not blessed with great range  she usually delivers heartwarming performances from a promising opening  the story slides downhill all the way to the end  i found nothing humorous about burning down the home of cooper's wouldbe inlaws  the butler in such a fastidious  nonsmoking household would never just blithely walk away  allowing cooper to continue smoking  or alternatively he would certainly supply him with some means of disposing of his illtimed cigarette  moreover  nobody with any common sense would permit himself to be left holding a lit cigarette without asking for some means of disposing of it  and finally  nobody in his right mind crushes out a cigarette in a handkerchief and sticks it in his pocket  this whole sequence just made cooper seem foolish and gauche  it is a poor contrivance  ill conceived and filmed in a way that induces ridicule not laughter  the forced medical examination of cooper is equally contrived  nobody lets himself undergo a complete medical examination without his being advised of its purpose or giving his consent  that cooper did so is too removed from reality to be funny  it's absurd  stealing babies from hospitals is a serious legal offense  and that  too  is nothing to laugh about  finally  the scenes of cooper's overly fastidious  neurotic attention to his baby's feeding and weight may have struck a nerve with a few people who have experienced anxiety over their own newborn babies  but to me they just seem tedious and slow  the wardrobe and prop departments went over the top in those scenes  while paradoxically  the script writer went to sleep the lines are just not in the script to generate humor  they just miss on all cylinders  the laughs come not a mileaminute  but more like a light yearaminute  the only time the movie has any energy or humor is when frank morgan is on camera the scene that is totally wasted is when both of cooper's love interests and their respective fathers are cooped up in the same hotel room together  there is probably a rich vein of humor somewhere in that mine  but none of it was extracted in the end  one of the two very likable girls is going to get hurt  predictably  it is the anita louise character  who gets jilted on her wouldbewedding night  while it is not on camera  that is her fate  and it is not particularly funny  even as a loose end  she hadn't done anything in this film to make me unsympathetic unlike gail patrick  say  in my favorite wife  consequently  i was expecting perhaps hoping is a better word in the context of the film  for anita louise to enjoy a happy ending  too  the fact that such a nice character is essentially wiped out at the movie's end really undermines the effect of the happy ending for cooper and wright i kept waiting for something to happen  for the witty dialog so characteristic of movies of the era  and it never delivered  a good performance by frank morgan in a slightly different role is totally wasted here ,0.12973925471305847,1,this movie

process of finding the best singer  but to the audience that is now quite savvy  already having done this numerous times on fox there was the host  george stroumboulopoulos was no ryan seacrest  in fact  he was as lackluster as can be  he actually sucked what little energy there was in the program  dry  how he got that job was the second biggest mystery of the show the first was how did they pick the competitors for this program  this was literally a talentfree talent show  ok  perhaps that's an exaggeration  and granted  the performers all have to be relatively close in ability  because if they were not  there wouldn't be a contest  if only one person was good  there would be no suspense  so  i get that they all needed to be comparable  but they all should have had some chops  additionally  the judges were running a singing academy  so the program was part fame  as well  clearly these performers desperately needed those lessons  but you need some extremely talented people to teach those with little talent to be talented  and that definitely wasn't what was happening here it seemed in casting the show  the priority was on the homelife elements  as all of the players were very attractive to look at  in equal parts to how badly they vocalized  but the filmed segments in their house were so chopped and sliced  you couldn't get into the stories that were starting to happen  so the show didn't capture the events there  either as badly devised as all of that was  the one had an incredible  unbelievable  fatal design flaw built into the results that made it completely laughable the audience phoned in their votes for who they liked the best  just like on ai  but then  after the audience vote was revealed  the bottom three contestants were forced to sing a final song  the music experts  based on that performance  chose one person from the three to save for the following week  and then  the contestants who were safe got to vote for who they wanted to keep from the remaining two  sending the remaining contestant home the design flaw was that the contestants had the final say  i mean  if you were in a music competition and you wanted to get as far along the path as you could  would you vote to keep the better singer  or would you try to get rid of your toughest rival  any first season viewer of cbs's survivor could answer that one  and that's exactly what happened on the program  the person who had the better potential was lost  and the contestants voted back the one who had no talent at all  on top of that  the contestant who was just saved from the bottom by the experts was also allowed to vote against the remaining two  it was a complete farce  maybe if they let the contestants vote first  at least the experts would save the

1,i love midnight cowboy and have it in my video collection as it is a favorite of mine  what is interesting to me is how when midnight cowboy came out in it was so shocking to viewers that it was rated x  of course  at that time x meant maturity  since i was only two years old at the time of the movie's release  it is hard for me to imagine just how shocked viewers were back then  however  when i try to take into account that many of the topics covered in the film  which included prostitution the title itself was slang for a male prostitute homosexuality  loneliness  physical and to some extent emotional as well abuse and drugs are hard for many people to talk about to this day  i can begin to get a sense of what viewers of this movie thought back on its release  it is worth noting that in the 's  midnight cowboy was downgraded to an r rating and even though it is still rated r  some of the scenes could almost be rated pg by today's standards i want to briefly give a synopsis of the plot although it is probably known to almost anyone who has heard of the movie  jon voight plays a young man named joe buck from texas who decides that he can make it big as a male hustler in new york city escorting rich women  he emulates cowboy actors like roy rogers by wearing a cowboy outfit thinking that that will impress women  after being rejected by all the women he has come across  he meets a sleazy conman named enrico ratso rizzo who is played by dustin hoffman  ratso convinces joe that he can make all kinds of money if he has a manager  once again  joe is conned and before long is homeless  however  joe comes across ratso and is invited to stay in a dilapidated apartment  without giving away much more of the plot  i want to say that the remainder of the movie deals with joe and ratso as they try to help one another in an attempt to fulfill their dreams  i e  joe making it as a gigolo and ratso going down to florida where he thinks he can regain his health i want to make some comments about the movie itself  first of all  the acting is excellent  especially the leads  although the movie is really very sad from the beginning to the end  there are some classic scenes  in fact  there are some scenes that while they are not intended to be funny  i find them amusing  for example  there is the classic scene where dustin hoffman and jon voight are walking down a city street and a cab practically runs them over  dustin hoffman bangs on the cab and says hey  i'm walkin' here  i'm walkin' here  i get a kick out of that scene because it is so typical of new york city where so many people are in a hurry  another scene that comes to mind is the scene where ratso dustin hoffman sends joe jon voight to a guy named o'daniel  what is amusing is that at first  we think o'daniel is there to recruit gigolos and can see why joe is getting so excited but then we begin to realize that o'daniel is nothing but a religious nut  in addition to the two scenes i mentioned  i love the scene where ratso and joe are arguing in their apartment when ratso says to joe that his cowboy outfit only attracts homosexuals and joe says in selfdefense john wayne  you gonna tell me he's a fag  what i like is the delivery in that scene i would say that even though midnight cowboy was set in the late ''s  much of it rings true today  that's because although the area around nd street in new york has been cleaned up in the form of disneyfication in the last several years  homelessness is still just as prevalent there now as it was years ago  also  many people have unrealistic dreams of how they are going to strike it big only to have their dreams smashed as was the case with the jon voight character  one thing that impresses me about jon voight's character is how he is a survivor and i felt that at the end of the movie  he had matured a great deal and that ratso dustin hoffman's character was a good influence on him in conclusion  i want to say that i suggest that when watching this movie  one should watch it at least a couple of times because there are so many things that go on  for example  there are a bunch of flashback and dream sequences that made more sense to me after a couple of viewings  also  what i find interesting is that there is a lot in this movie that is left to interpretation such as what really happened with joe buck jon voight's character and the people who were in his life in texas  even the ending  while i don't want to give it away for those who have not seen the movie  is rather openended ,0.9632052183151244,0,i love midnight cowboy and have it in my videotaping collection as it is a favorite of mine what is interesting to me is how when midnight cowboy came out in it was so terrible to viewers that it was rated x of course at that time x intentioned matured since i was only two olds old at the time of the movie's release it is arduous for me to imagine just how shocked viewers were back then however when i attempting to take into account that many of the topics covered in the movie which inserted hooker the name itself was slang for a mens prostitute homosexuality loneliness physical and to some extent emotional as well misused and drugs are hard for many people to talk about to this day i can begin to obtain a sense of what viewers of this movie thoughts revert on its release it is worth noting that in the 's midnight cowboy was downgraded to an r rating and even notwithstanding it is still ranked r some of the scenes could almost be categorized pg by today's standards i want to briefly lend a synopsis of the plot although it is probably known to nigh anyone who has heard of the films jon voight play a young man named joe buck from texas who decides that he can make it big as a male hustler in new york city escorting rich women he emulates cowboy actors like roy rogers by wearing a cowboy outfit thinking that that will impress women after being rejected by all the women he has come across he meets a sleazy conman named henri ratso rizzo who is played by dustin hoffman ratso convinces joe that he can make all kinds of money if he has a manger once again joe is conned and before long is homeless however joe comes across ratso and is invited to stay in a dilapidated townhouse without giving away much more of the plot i want to say that the remainder of the movie deals with joe and ratso as they try to help one another in an attempt to fulfill their dreams i e joe making it as a gigolo and ratso going down to florida where he thinks he can regain his health i want to make some comments about the movie itself first of all the acting is superb especially the leads although the movie is really very unfortunate from the beginning to the end there are some classic scenes in fact there are some scenes that while they are not intended to be funny i find them amusing for example there is the classic scene where dustin hoffman and jon voight are walking down a city street and a cab practically runs them over dustin hoffman bangs on the cab and says hey i'm walkin' here i'm walkin' here i get a kick out of that site because it is so typical of new york city where so many people are in a hurry another scene that comes to mind is the scene where ratso dustin schmidt sends joe jon voight to a guy named o'daniel what is amusing is that at outset we think o'daniel is there to recruit gigolos and can see why joe is getting so excited but then we begin to realize that o'daniel is nothing but a religious nut in plus to the two scenes i alluded i love the scene where ratso and joe are arguing in their apartment when ratso says to joe that his cowboy outfit only attracts homosexuals and evel says in selfdefense john wayne you gonna tell me he's a fag what i like is the delivery in that scene i would say that even though midnight cowboy was sets in the late ''s much of it rings true today that's because although the area around dna street in new york has been cleaned up in the form of disneyfication in the last several years homelessness is still just as prevalent there now as it was years ago also many people have impractical dreams of how they are

least there are a few legit scenes of characters inanely grappling with rubbery tentacles in pretty amusing fashion  i also chuckled at the disparities between different representations of the octopus  the cgi shots of the creature as a whole vary over the course of the film  they are also different not only in size but appearance to the practical shots of it  and there are scenes where the tentacle action suggests that the makers had abandoned pretending they were making a film about an octopus and just envisioned their creature as a bunch of miscellaneous tentacles  the scenes of the creature attacking people get old pretty swiftly  but there are a few funny scenes where it takes on other things  like a boat and a crane  yes  these scenes are poor  but they did make me chuckle  undisputable highlight though is a hilarious sequence in which the octopus takes on a new york landmark  the scene may not be much more than a minute but it really is inspired  and well worth looking up on youtube  apart from that things are uninspired all round  a pg level lack of gore or nastiness stops this one from even pulling off much in the trash good times the film does take a turn into semi gripping disaster movie territory at the end  but i can't really give it credit because the best shots in the last few scenes were culled from the stallone flick daylight which by my recollection is quite good  altogether this was pretty rubbishy stuff and not something i'd really recommend to anyone except creature feature die hards  better than a poke in the eye with a wet stick  but not by

character in this reality dance macabre gives a creepy kid a bottle of max von sydow holy water and reassures him by telling this boy that he  too  had a unspecified bad experience as a child with things that came out of the closet and the  catholic  church gave him a holy water to fend off the things coming out of the closet i knew i should have given monday night football another shot the shtick behind paranormal state is a group of penn state students all got together and started their own ghost hunting club  or society  or super adventure club  and they run around pennsylvania researching the most terrible hauntings and the lost plot to an m  night shymalan movie the they is kind of a misnomer  really paranormal state revolves around a nittany lion named ryan buell who would probably be running penn state's yearly anime convention if it wasn't for this show  he is often accompanied on investigations by hot coeds and some other people seen in the credits but rarely caught on camera  hey  are they ghosts too  this is ryan buell's show  paranormal state is his vehicle as we like to say in the biz  and  oh  what a dull ride in a vehicle he can be did i mention ryan narrates the entire episode of paranormal state in a star dateless director's log voice over  almost immediately that gets annoying because the obvious intention is to give ryan's ghost hunting some gravitas  but his filtered monotone does nothing but provoke grunts and laughs  seriously  every serious intonation sounds like the radio chatter from a call of duty video game the investigations  the plot that each episode revolves around  are interesting on the surface  no haunted inns or restaurants to be found in paranormal state this is a show about fearing the unknown like a good catholic boy and by god they give you stuff to fear  small children are harassed  things loom in the dark  voices encourage the living to kill  and the aleister crowely in me rubs my hands  of the two episodes i watched each revolved around violent  nasty hauntings tied to violent  nasty deaths  maybe maybe not  everything in paranormal state is shorthanded into half hour  dog the bounty  er  ghost hunter blocks  every time there is an interesting  verifiable shred of evidence  the murder of a family in a farmhouse in the s  the proof is waved in front of the viewer like a con artist trying to convince you a stack of papers currently under your nose is proof of that ten million coming from nigeria and then yanked away before you can get a good gander  at least with scifi channel's ghost hunters there is a somewhat overexhaustive need to trot out every possible shred of evidence and present it to the viewer  evps that could be a rat farting  cold spots in a drafty house  and orbs that even the ghost hunters themselves discount as dust  it is a sort of scooby doo like approach that makes ghost hunters  almost believable whereas paranormal state claims to have evps but gives the viewer a ten second video clip of a wave file in garage band with no audio  yep  see  an evp  right  people are claiming to see dark figures in the basement  well  we will just go and see about that  while leaving the night vision camera on an enthralling stationary shot of the living room  ryan  the intrepid leader of this pack of penn state graduates  is claiming to see visions of a demon's name he knows and that might be involved in a paranormal haunting  but he can't tell us  the audience  or his team of gothed out undergrads  because  he can't  you never say a demon's name out loud  ryan informs the wide eyed coed who dare inquires well  how very very convenient for you  especially since this is a television show where the audience cannot read your mind paranormal state is all turn and no prestige  the audience gets told what is supposedly happening but you never see an ounce of proof that the creepy kid is seeing dead people  not even grainy video of a chair moving  or a black blob running between prison cells  nothing  you are just told what happened by ryan in yet another mechanical voice over if you are going to try and spook me dress it up a little  if you are trying to sway me  show me a orb or a blob and have the fat chick who works days at hot topic tell me why that black orb is really the spirit of an ax murderer  and if you want to make me watch a ghost hunting show give me something besides trotting out lorraine warren by the second episode paranormal state is weak sauce  not really worth watching unless you are hard up for tv time  or just have that thin

paranormal state is his vehicle as we like to say in the biz and oh what a dull ride in a car he can be did i mention ryan portrays the entire episode of uncanny state in a stars dateless director's log voice over almost immediately that gets irksome because the obvious intention is to give ryan's ghost hunting some gravitas but his filtered monotone does nothing but provoke grunts and laughs harshly every serious eloquence sounds like the radio chatter from a call of duty video game the investigations the plot that each episode revolves about are interesting on the surface no haunted inns or restaurants to be found in supernatural state this is a shows about fearing the unknown like a good catholic boy and by deus they give you stuff to fear small children are harassed subjects loom in the dark voices encourage the living to kill and the exmrs crowely in me rubs my manos of the two episodes i watched each revolved around violent nasty hauntings tied to violent nasty deaths maybe maybe not everything in paranormal state is shorthanded into average hour dog the bounty er ghost hunter blocks all time there is an interesting verifiable shred of evidence the murder of a family in a farmhouse in the s the proofs is waved in newsweek of the viewer like a con artist trying to convince you a stack of papers currently under your nose is proof of that ten million coming from nigeria and then yanked away before you can get a good evilness at least with scifi channel's ghost hunters there is a somewhat overexhaustive need to trot out every possible shred of evidence and presents it to the viewer evps that would be a rat farting cold spots in a drafty house and orbs that even the ghostbusters hunters themselves refunded as dust it is a sort of scooby doo like approach that makes ghost hunters almost believable whereas paranormal state claims to have evps but gives the viewer a ten second video clip of a wave file in garage strip with no audio yep see an evp right people are claiming to see dark figures in the basement well we will just go and see about that while leaving the night vision camera on an enthralling stationary shot of the live room ryan the intrepid leader of this pack of penn state graduates is asserting to see visions of a demon's name he knows and that maybe be involved in a paranormal haunting but he can't tell us the audience or his team of gothed out undergrads because he can't you never told a demon's name out loud ryan informs the wide eyed coed who dare inquires well how very very convenient for you especially since this is a television show where the audience cannot read your mind paranormal state is all turn and no prestige the viewers gets told what is supposedly occured but you never see an ounce of proof that the creepy kid is seeing dead people not even grainy video of a chair moving or a black blob running between prison heaps nothing you are just tell what happened by ryan in nevertheless another mechanical voice over if you are going to try and spook me garb it up a little if you are trying to influences me show me a orb or a blob and have the fat chick who works days at hot topic tell me why that ebony orb is really the spirit of an ax murderer and if you want to make me watch a ghost hunting show give me something besides trotting out lauren warren by the second episode paranormal state is weak sauce not honestly worth watching unless you are hard up for tv time or just have that thin of a dvd collection or unless you want to know what really happened in that closet with the holy

wreckage  and we aren't shown any of it  budget constraints alloyed with utter incompetence generally mean you won't have anything worth showing  so why try  the sets were utterly laughable  club scum was an obvious diner  the house appears to have been a vacant house probably for rent or sale which the production company got hold of for an hour or two to do the shoot  the spacecraft is something i

her proud of him  i'm sure this was intended to make their reconciliation oh so touching at the end  but any guy with real selfrespect would have told her to go to hell and left her  nick is

a phonesex freak in red shorts who dreams of a night with a spandexclad dominatrix type  but he's so effeminate that he's more likely gay than not  one of the girls is a prude and the other is a sleaze and the hobgoblins  at the end they all head back to the vault where they've lived for years  why  who knows  who cares  watch this film and be amazed at how primitive filmmaking in our modern

0,a frustrating documentary  louis kahn's son  who saw his father only minimally during his childhood because he was a member of just one of the three separate families his father had created  takes on the task of trying to learn more about his father through an exploration of his architecture and his life  it sounds like a great idea for a documentary  but it ends up flat and uninteresting sadly  the basic problem is that kahn's son  nathaniel  is not just one of the film's protagonists  he is also director  writer  producer  interviewer and narrator  nathaniel seems both too inexperienced and possibly too close to the material to function well in any of these roles  further  while he seems like a nice enough guy  he doesn't have much screen presence  so the fact that he is the only constant in the film becomes wearing  nathaniel also comes across as an unprepared and amateurish interviewer  there are several points where an interviewee makes an interesting or provocative statement and the camera cuts to a shot of nathaniel offering little more than a blank stare and a sort of timid uhhuh  as if he's a little panicked that he's going to have to come up with something to say in response  at times  i felt embarrassed watching people who might have had truly interesting things to say about kahn or at least better things to do with their time seeming to realize that they were in the hands of an interviewer who was going to rely on them to direct the conversation  nathaniel's dual role as both documentarian and lost son seem to do more to hurt the film than help  one senses that some of the interviewees are a little reluctant to really open up about negative aspects of kahn's personality and career  presumably because it's not clear from nathaniel whether he's looking to dig into the truth or simply wants to hear nice stories about his dad  preferably ones that will confirm his hope that his dad really did care more for nathaniel and his mother than seems likely  his passive approach as an interviewer may stem directly from this conflict  the only person nathaniel does push is his own mother  but those conversations tend to feel a little like bad teen drama aren't you angry  mom  and don't offer much in terms of helping us or nathaniel understand kahn or the loyalty he evoked from those around him  what the film desperately lacks is shaping by an experienced and independent hand  not to exclude nathaniel  but to balance his subjectivity and inexperience  an independent director could have stood away from the material  given more thought to what the interviewees could contribute and  one hopes  cut out those portions of the documentary process that just don't work  such as the weird segment with the guy who claims to have see kahn die which made it look as if nathaniel was just being taken in by some loony or the entire bit about hooking up with kahn's first cousin  who had nothing to add about kahn or nathaniel  too many times nathaniel makes us watch him standing in or near a kahn building buttonholing strangers to tell them that his father was the designer  ah huh  thaaat's nice  sir  umm i gotta go now  i understand why these things might be important to nathaniel and that showing the documentary process is sometimes interesting  but this is one of those examples of when a documentary can be too personal as an aside  i thought the score written for the film was great  but  one of the oddest moments in the entire thing for me was when  during the tour of the kimball art museum  the voiceover quotes kahn as making a comparison between architecture and beethoven's fifth symphony  the music being played at the same time  beethoven's ninth symphony  a mistake  a miscue  who knows  it did make me laugh  kahn was a great architect and it's clear that he was an unusual human being and had an intriguing life story  there's definitely a good documentary to be made about him  one is sympathetic to nathaniel's search for the father he didn't know  but i'm not sure whether that is an interesting story  neither works so well in this film ,0.01465275976806879,0,a frustrating documentary louis kahn's son who saw his

1,i would probably not have bothered to comment on this film if i had not been disturbed by the constant references made to it here in north america as a porn film  our obsession with what is  or should be  regarded as pornographic remains a relic of the 'guidance' provided to film makers by the hayes committee many  many years ago and it is now really time that we relegate it to the past  so far we have not progressed far beyond establishing a somewhat arbitrary division between what we now term 'soft' and 'hard' porn  with both carrying the same pornography label  it is time for us all recognise that neither the r rated soft porn  release version of this film  nor the unrated version hard porn  available on dvd were in any way pornographic in legal terms pornography is defined by its capacity to deprave or corrupt  many classic books such as lady chatterley's lover  fanny hill  women in love  the story of 'o' or moll flanders have been prosecuted for pornographic content  tried by jury and cleared on the basis of this definition  but in practice most ordinary citizens are not interested in what they regard as legal equivocation  and apply a simpler test that is rather too stringent when applied to books or films which are very close to the line  but serves to quickly clear most others from any taint of pornography  although the hayes code would have rated aiw as unacceptable both for nudity and for its depictions of sexual activities  in practice most people today accept that where the basic message of a book or film is clearly designed to encourage the development of long term stable family relationships in which the participants find real fulfillment  it cannot be regarded as pornographic this does not mean that works depicting unsatisfactory or unstable relationships should be recognised as pornographic  only that these may need a more sophisticated assessment  in aiw  we have a film about a young female librarian who has had a rather sheltered upbringing  and keeps her suitor at arms length because of a feeling that this is what morality requires her to do  after he gets too frustrated by this and threatens to leave her  she falls asleep and dreams she is transported to a wonderland closely based on that of lewis carrol where everyone she meets is totally uninhibited about their sexual needs  she is shocked  but is a kind person who takes things as she finds them  so before long she finds her own prejudices gradually melting away  she wakes up when her boyfriend returns to break off their affair  but her attitude to him has changed so completely that their relationship is fully restored  and the film ends with them living 'happily ever after' with their children in a home with a white picket fence and a family dog  an ending clearly directed to those romantics who remain very young at heart pornographic   hardly  suitable viewing for children   well probably not quite  unless they have very progressive parents r rating   pg would be more appropriate today entertaining for viewers in most age groups   yes  but the film has its faults  these are discussed in many of the comments here on imdb  however most commentators clearly appreciated and enjoyed it i believe the only pornography associated with this film was the reported claim by an antipornography activist of scientific proof that a magazine picture of kristin debell was a photographic montage of images of the face of a ten year old with various body parts of adult models  these and other comments seriously damaged the career of a very promising young actress  but today the film appears to be on its way to becoming a cult classic  several home video productions have been released in both vhs and dvd format  the last was a dvd containing both the r rated and unrated versions of the film  released by subversive cinema in copies of this were readily available until a few months ago  now they are almost exhausted and the mail order vendors who still have copies in stock are selling them at many times their original price  a situation which usually quickly results in a new dvd release appearing  this continuing interest nearly years after the original film was released points to near classic status commentators on this database are expected to provide fellow viewers with useful guidance on whether a film is worth watching or even collecting  my comments here were intended to stress the ongoing damage to the industry that still results from pressure on major studios to respect selfcensorship recommendations originating with the hayes committee  on this database such general comments are very quickly marked by readers as 'not helpful' and i seldom make them  but fortunately i still have space to add that

1,this is one of those unique horror films that requires a much more mature understanding of the word 'horror' in order for it to be appreciated  the main thing people may fail to realize that this story is told through the point of view a little boy and  as with most younger children  he gets frightened easily  mainly because he simply doesn't understand things  like why his father is hardly ever there for him  from watching the film you can see the husband arguing with his wife the balance between work time and family time and you can easily understand it  but the little boy doesn't  also one can imagine the boy being afraid of the woods  as it is established early on in the film  that the family is from the city  also  in the beginning as the family is traveling to the house they hit a deer  then get held up  then they argue with the locals about it  and the little boy surely didn't find this introduction to the woods pleasant at all the wendigo is ultimately what his young  innocent mind fabricates to explain all of this  there is the american indian legend  but when looking at the scene where the young boy hears about about it  it is explained to him like bluntly and simplistically  not because that's what the wendigo actually is  but because that is how he understands it  when you look at the film from this point of view you can really begin to appreciate it  obviously it was lowbudget and shot cheaply  but the jumping montages  use of light  and general eeriness more than make up for it  and the final question the film asks is  is it all in your head  or is it really out there  rated r  profanity  violence  and a sex scene,0.90129554271698,0,this is one of those particular horror films that requires a mucho more mature fathom of the phrase 'horror' in order for it to be commended the main thingy people may fail to realize that this stories is told through the point of view a little boy and as with most younger children he gets frightened easily mainly because he simply doesn't understand things like why his father is hardly ever there for him from watching the film you can seeing the husband arguing with his wife the balance between work timeframe and family time and you can easily understand it but the small dawg doesn't also one can presume the boy being fearful of the woods as it is formulate early on in the film that the family is from the city besides in the beginning as the relatives is traveling to the house they slugged a crackpot then gets held up then they argue with the inhabitants about it and the little bloke surely didn't unearth this introduction to the woods pleasant at all the wendigo is ultimately what his young innocent intellect fabricates to explain all of this there is the americas indian legends but when looking at the scene where the young bloke listen about about it it is explained to him like bluntly and simplistically not because that's what the wendigo actually is but because that is how he understand it when you listens at the movie from this point of view you can really begin to thankful it obviously it was lowbudget and shot cheaply but the jumping montages use of light and general eeriness more than render up for it and the conclusive problem the films asks is is it all in your head or is it truthfully out there rated r profanity violence and a sex scene,0.4722546339035034,36,0.9072350645451815,Y,0.12

1,if it is true that sadomasochism is a twosided coin which contains the whole in the diverse expression of its opposites  then the cinematic portrait of erika kohut has its reality  professor kohut treats her piano students with a kind of fascist sadism while longing for the same for herself  her outward expression projects her desire  that is why she can hurt without guilt or remorse along comes talented  charming  handsome young walter klemmer benoit magimel who is attracted to her because of her passion and her intensity  he wants to become her student so as to be close to her  she rejects him out of hand  but because of his talent the vienna conservatory votes him in  he falls in love with her  again she pushes him away  but he will not take no for an answer  and thereby begins his own descent into depravity and loss of selfrespect the question the viewer might ask at this point is  who is in control  the sadist or the masochist  indeed who is the sadist and who the masochist  it is hard to tell  is it the person who has just been greatly abused both psychologically and physically  who is actually lying wounded on the floor in grotesque triumphant and fulfillment  or is it the person who is rushing out the door  sated  giving the order that no one is to know what happened but erika is not just a sadomasochistic freak  she is a sex extreme freak  she wants to experience the extremes of human sexuality while maintaining the facade of respectability  actually that isn't even true  she says she doesn't care what others think  she doesn't care if they walk in and find her bleeding on the floor because she is in love  love  she calls it  for her sex and love are one and the same at one point walter tells her that love isn't everything  how ironic such a superfluity is to her  how gratuitous the comment the movie is beautifully cut and masterfully directed by michael haneke who spins the tale with expert camera work and carefully constructed sets in which the essence of the action is not just clear but exemplified as in the bathroom when walter propels himself high above the top of the stall to find erika within  he also employs a fine positioning of the players so that they are always where they should be with well timed cuts from one angle to another  this is particularly important in the scene in which erika  like a blooddrained corpse caught in stark white and black light  lies under her lover  rigid as stone  here for the most part we only see her face and the stark outline of her neck with its pulsating artery  we don't need to see any more the part of erika kohut is perfect for isabelle huppert who is not afraid of extremes  indeed she excels in them  i have seen her in a number of movies and what she does better than almost anyone is become the character body and soul  like the woman she plays in this movie she is unafraid of what others may think and cares little about her appearance in a decorative sense  what matters to her is the performance and the challenge  no part is too demanding  no character too depraved  it's as if huppert wants to experience all of humanity  and wants us to watch her as she does  she is always fascinating and nearly flawless  she is not merely a leading light of the french cinema  she is one of the great actresses of our time who has put together an amazingly diverse body of work i think it is highly instructive and affords us a wonderful and striking contrast to compare her performance here with her performance in the lacemaker la dentellière from when she was years old  there she was apple sweet in her red hair and freckles and her pretty face and her cute little figure playing pomme  a parisian apprentice hairdresser  her character was shy about sex and modestjust an ordinary french girl who hoped one day to be a beautician  here she is a selfdestructive witch  bitter with hateful knowledge of herself  shameless and entirely depraved huppert is fortunate in being an actress in france where there are parts like this for women past the age of starlets  hollywood could never make a movie like this  in the american cinema  only a handful of the very best and hardest working actresses can hope to have a career after the age of about thirty  huppert greatly increases her exposure because of her ability and range  but also because she is willing to play unsympathetic roles  here and also in la cérémonie  in which she plays a vile  spiteful murderess do see this for isabelle huppert  you won't forget her or the character she brings to

0,first of all  the nature in the movie is beautiful  and there is a bit of mongolian music  well  the horses looked mongolian and the camels  but that's about all what was mongolian in it  oh  borte is played by a mongolian actress  albeit a lame performance  but she is pretty  which redeems a bit the lack of performance on her part but  i totally failed to understand what was the point of this painfulto watch piece of hour fantasy created by mr bodrov  the plot totally lacked any sense of cohesion  there was no logic behind the development of the plot  in fact  there was hardly any story at all  just a number of loosely tied scenes with a bunch of guys in mongolian clothes  speaking some kinda pidgin that is supposed to sound like mongolian  most actors were either japanese  russian or chinese  most scenes were shot in china  kazakhstan or russia and there were a lot of disturbing pathos about what is it to be a mongolian the dialog is primitive and the scenes with dialog are slow  the battle scenes are laughable  all the supernatural pathos is lame and is obviously there only to make up for the lack of the story the japanese actor was like a wooden doll  and looking at him one wouldn't get any idea how this person could become a leader who could unite the nomadic tribes  he looked sleepy  soft  stiff and pitiful for the most part of the movie and i don't even want to start on the subject of the historical relevance of this piece of cinematic waste  to see chinggiskhan half of the movie as a slave  to see his two first kids be born from other men  to see his wife selling herself to the tangut merchant  my blood starts to boil  and where is the beautiful story about the friendship between temujin and jamukha  one could make a great movie out of it  where is the story of the rise of temujin  of his childhood  of his relationship with his family  with his brothers  of how he struggled to survive among mighty enemies of his family  where is van khan  who helped him a lot  where is the depiction of life in the steppe  of the life of the nomads  of their traditions  of their relations with the other nations around them where is development of the characters  we totally fail to see what brought temujin together with jamukha and what brought them apart and most important  how temujin became chinggiskhan  how he  an outcast with no wealth and military power managed to unite the mongolian tribes and create such an organized and effective war machine that crushed one nation after another and created the largest land empire in history  all this could make

0,if i could give this excuse for a film a or negative rating i would  i was stupid enough to pick this dvd up in the shop  read the blurb and think  that sounds quite good  i'll spend £ and buy it  all i got at the end of it was a £ coaster  absolutely awful  i don't even know where to begin  i have no idea why anyone has given this more than stars because i can't think of one good thing to say about it  the plot is basically  people go into an unexplored cave  one of them is a reporter  noone else knows they are there  when they get in the cave  they can't get out and they get killed off one by one by a monster  there turns out to be no reason for the reporter  one of the characters has some past demons where his ex girlfriend drowns in a cave years ago  there seems to be no relevance or reason for that either  just a rubbish attempt at character building i assume  anyway  the monster turns out to be a guy that wandered into the cave as a normal little kid and has lived in there all his life  this for no reason makes him superhuman  able to glow  see in the dark  take bullets  breathe underwater  be in places at once and have insane strength able to move boulders  carry grown men as dead weight  etc  in the end scene there are women left alive  they wake up naked  just covered in some bit of rug or something  they then find a picture of a kid  the monster then bursts in the door  wrapped in a carpet with some sort of animal skull over his head says in the directors commentary it was a crow's skull  if so that would be the frekin biggest crow i have seen in my life and quite literally goes raaah  like a kiddie on halloween  i was watching it with my boyfriend and at that point he literally burst out laughing  the guy then sees a picture of himself as a kid and has a flashback to him sitting under a tree with his face all burnt and then getting up and wandering into the cave  that is the extent of the back story to why he mutilates people and it leaves you feeling a bit cheated for a story  the monster then kills one of the women and brutally rapes the other one  cut to end credits  i know the rape scene was designed to be shocking  but as a woman it just made me feel quite ill and was the thing that affected me the most in the whole film  he could have killed her and cut her into pieces and ate her and it would have been less horrific than the rape scene there are so many things that are left unanswered at the end  aside from all this  the scenes where there was minutes at a time of just black and nothing else was annoying and the constant nauseating camera angles where it's all upside down and you can't see what's going on wound me up so much at one point i almost turned it off  an absolutely terrible film  you might as well get the money you were going to spend on it and set fire to it  it would be money better spent  as like some clever person posting above me said  once you've watched it  you can't un watch it

1,if vampire tales are your cup of blood  then this gothfest based on the anne rice vampire chronicles should prove to be a satisfying experience  a veritable consortium of the undead in a contemporary setting  queen of the damned ' directed by michael rymer  is a story of shadows and darkness  and of the unfortunate souls who dwell therein for eternity  the vampire lestat stuart townsend  bored with a world that no longer excites him  has been asleep' for many years  but suddenly  the sounds of that world he hears from his extended slumber change  and liking what he hears  he ventures forth to investigate  what he finds is a world filled with new sounds  a new kind of music driving and penetrating sounds that assault the senses and make him feel alive and welcome  and he knows that at long last his time has come  that it is time for him and those like him to come out into the open and face the world on their terms  toward that end he becomes the front man for a band a singer and performer unlike any the world has ever known  he presents himself as a vampire  and very quickly amasses a following that extends far beyond london where it all begins  and will ultimately take him to death valley  california  where he plans to give a concert that promises to be beyond anything anyone has ever seen or experienced  lestat is powerful  without question  but there are those of his kind who do not take favorably to the fact that he has revealed them  one of whom is marius vincent perez  a vampire powerful in his own right the vampire  in fact  who made' lestat so many years before and they are gathering  coming together and making their plans to meet lestat at the concert  and they are not going for the music  but there is something else  as well  at one point

chosen to rule by her side as her king  lestat  and at the concert  rest assured  akasha will be in attendance  without fail  make no mistake  this is lestat's story  and rymer presents it amid a setting rich with atmosphere and with some exquisite moments  though his film has less bite to it than say  interview with the vampire ' or bram stoker's dracula ' he sets a good pace  and there are some scenes that provide some real thrills  but overall the film isn't as soaked in menace as it could be  or as much as one might expect  in the final tally  in fact  the amount of flesh that is incinerated wins out over actual bloodletting  though there is more than a taste of gore  and more than a fair share of lips and mouths dripping with the red stuff  there's some good f  x on hand  too  especially in the sequences that accentuate the speed of the vampires  as they move and hurtle through the air faster than the naked eye can discern  it's a decent job by rymer  but he could have put more teeth into it had he played up the alienation hinted at by lestat  as it is  you get a sense of his detachment  but not enough to get you totally involved  in interview with the vampire ' tom cruise brought some charismatic star power to the role of lestat  but townsend is even more effective  with a look and an attitude that captures lestat perfectly  he plays him with a sense of acceptance  and under closer scrutiny you may even find a hint of remorse and longing  it's a good performance  and one that sells his character convincingly  as marius  vincent perez does a nice job  too he is  in fact  one of the strengths of the film though his character is a bit ambiguous  that  however  has more to do with the way he was written than with perez's performance  which is quite good  turning in noteworthy performances  as well  are marguerite moreau  as jesse  a young woman too curious for her own goo and the gorgeous lena olin as maharet  jesse's aunt  who ultimately plays a pivotal role in the outcome of the drama involving lestat and akasha  and as akasha  aaliyah is an absolutely riveting presence  what more can one say about her other than she is a gifted performer  with tremendous talent and beauty  and  tragically  she has left us much too soon  the supporting cast includes paul mcgann  david   christian manon  mael   claudia black  pandora   bruce spence  khayman   matthew newton  armand   tiriel mora  roger  and megan dorman  maudy   with a much stronger story than the usual offerings of this particular genre  anne rice fans  especially  will be pleased with queen of the damned ' a film nicely crafted and delivered by director rymer and his engaging cast  by focusing attention on the drama of the story and the way it's presented rather than

0,where do i begin  its one of the most frustrating movies i've seen because it makes a lot of sense in terms of the point but it comes off as seriously stupid  a movie about a ghost inhabited bed  the first minutes of the movie shows a black and white flashback of a weird looking fat dude going dominatrix on a fabienne from pulp fiction lookalike contest winner and strangles her with his tie  this is supposed to set up how the bed factors into the story  still though  if you wanted an opening to keep people interested or send them away early  having a strangulation is the way to do it  fast forward to the present day  a married couple moves into an apartment with a friendly landlord and begins unpacking their things  so far everything's normal  then one night while doing the hippity dippity on a single mattress  they realize they need a bed frame  this is where things get fishy  why didn't they bring or buy a gd damn bed frame before they got there  we learn that the door leading to the attic where the first minutes took place doesn't open but then once the couple realizes they need a bed frame  the door magically opens  they go up to the attic and discover the old bed frame and decide to bring it downstairs and their lovemaking days are saved  or so they thought  the rest of the movie centers around the both of them being haunted by the bedframe  the female is an artist so she starts drawing up the ghoulish images she dreams about and the male is a photographer so he starts having his models act as if they're bring tortured or tied up one of which has gray hair and appears over years old  yuck the female grows increasingly scared and she discovers the house she lives in was once a haven for serial killings and murders which bring about the end to the movie  they find the friendly landlord murdered which makes no sense since ghosts need to take a human form to kill and decide to get the hell out of dodge  while packing up  the husband moronically goes up into the attic where he is possessed by the crazy fat dude and the female bashes his skull in before the cops show up and take her to a mental ward where she kills some dude trying to hit on her well if

fabienne from pulp imagination lookalike contest triumphs and strangles her with his tie this is supposed to sets up how the bed factors into the story still though if you wanted an opening to keep people interested or send them away early having a strangulation is the way to do it fast forward to the present day a married couple moves into an apartment with a friendly landlord and begins unpacking their things so far everything's normal then one night while doing the hippity dippity on a single cushions they realize they need a bed fabric this is where things get fishy why didn't they bring or buy a gd damn bed fabric before they got there we learn that the door leading to the attic where the first mn took place doesn't open but then once the couple realizes they need a bed frame the stargate magically opens they go up to the attic and discover the antique bed fabric and decide to brings it downstairs and their lovemaking days are saved or so they thought the rest of the movie centers around the both of them being haunted by the bedframe the women is an artist so she starts drawing up the grim images she dreams about and the male is a photographer so he starts having his models law as if they're bring tortured or tied up one of which has jack hair and transpires over years ancient yuck the female grows increasingly scared and she discovers the house she lives in was once a haven for serial killings and murders which bring about the end to the movie they find the amiable landlord murdered which makes no sensation after ghosts need to take a humankind form to kill and decide to get the dammit out of dodge while packing up the husband moronically goes up into the attic where he is possessed by the crazy fat fella and the women bashes his skull in before the cops show up and take her to a mental ward where she kills some dude trying to strike on her well if you've read this far you have to be thinking one thing why the hell didn't they just throw the bedframe

assassins with automatic weapons  they make a break for it and just manage to get out in a hail of gunfire  the main hall of the train station is now filled with corpses of innocent people that were caught in the crossfire  some would call that too sad and  or grim to put into what is supposed to be an enjoyable action flick  i call it honesty  most action movies tend to lean toward the safe side of showing violence and plot elements  this mostly means that in spite massive shootouts innocent people tend not to die or at least we don't see them die  the violence is all purely the good guys versus the bad guys with mainly the bad guys dying  a bit of common sense clearly shows this to be absurd renny harlin showed a hint of this in his first and sadly only hit  die hard the villains intentionally crash a plane full of people to get their point across  the scene was also filmed with a backup scene of a cargo plane with only a few people onboard going down  but the grimmer and probably more realistic scenario ended up being used  however  to fit the spirit of the first film  die hard was mostly a fun action movie  here  that grimmer and more convincing edge is pervasive  the violence is bloody  the one liners are hilarious  but with a certain style that more echoes natural human sarcasm than clichéd film wisecracks at key moments of action  the plot is also packed with more malicious intent than most action films  the villain is not just some rogue out for revenge or a mad grab at power  it is less ridiculous  but also more frightening than that  from recent films  the bourne trilogy almost gets there with its less cheesy than usual action film style  but this film is from and years before the bourne identity with matt damon made it to the big screen another interesting aspect is that the main hero is actually a heroine  and this is well before the movie version of tomb raider became a hit  what's more is that this heroine genuinely looks like she could take down john mcclane and then take his still lit cigarette  this movie marks geena davis's second actionheroine role and she still didn't manage to score a hit  while angelina jolie stars in tomb raider years later and scores a hit  the reasons are beyond me  completely lastly  this movie isn't all dark edged  there are many outrageous and spectacular set pieces that one can only see in an action film  the climatic explosion of a chemical bomb is an absolutely spectacular display of movie pyrotechnics  with more than one law of physics taking a convenient break  thus  there is

1,i have looked into the eye of this island  and what i saw was beautiful  proclaims one of the main characters in abc's award winning television show lost the series could be summarized as a drama story about a group of plane crash survivors stranded on an unknown island  but that would be doing the show a disservice  lost follows a large group of characters who come into conflict with the island  each other  and ultimately themselves as they struggle with their new way of life and their dependency on each other  the situation becomes more complicated when it becomes clear this isn't an ordinary island  either  and that they may not be alone my initial fear after hearing the concept of this series was the lack of new stories they could tell us after a certain period  but this proved to be unfounded  the narrative flows naturally  the dialogue is witty  the characters are memorable and the execution is superb  the island is a character all on its own  and to understand this comment you'd have to see the series for yourself  which only goes to show its originality and greatness at the time of writing this review  only the first two seasons have aired  and they're filled with strong episodes  my only mild criticism is that the second season seems to slow down a bit halfway  but then fortunately comes back in admirable shape for the final episodes if i can recommend one television series you should be following right now  it would certainly be this one  if you like excitement  adventure  character driven stories  an extremely strong cast and crew  beautiful locations  and an island that seems more spiritual than natural  lost is for you  just be sure you start at the beginning ,0.992171049118042,0,i have looked into the eye of this island and what i saw was beautiful declares someone of the main characters in abc's award win telly display lost the instalment could be recap as a drama story about a group of plane collisions survivors stranded on an unknown island but that ought be doing the show a disservice lost persisted a big group of characters who come into conflict with the island each other and ultimately themselves as they struggle with their novel routes of life and their dependency on each other the circumstances becomes more complex when it becomes sane this isn't an ordinary island either and that they maj not be alone my introductory scared after hearing the concept of this instalment was the lack of newest tales they could tell nous after a certain period but this proved to be unfounded the narrative flow understandably the dialogue is witty the personages are noteworthy and the enforcement is marvellous the isle is a character all on its own and to understand this comment you'd have to see the series for yourself which only disappears to show its individuality and magnitude at the time of literary this reviewed only the first two bouts have aired and they're filled with strong spells my only mild criticism is that the dry season looks to slow down a bite halfway but then fortunately occurs back in remarkable form for the last episodes if i can recommended one tvs series you should be thereafter ok now it should undoubtedly be this one if you like exuberance shenanigans character prompted stories an extremely strong hurled and sailor beautiful placements and an island that seems more intellectual than inseparable lost is for you just be convinced you start at the beginning,0.4640496969223023,59,0.8445353594389247,Y,0.2
1,this comment does contain spoilers  there are few actors that have an intangible to them  that innate quality which is an amalgamation of charisma  panache and swagger  it's the quality that can separate good actors from the truly great  i think george clooney has it and so does jack nicholson  you can look at clooney's subtle touches in scenes like his one word goodbye to andy garcia in ocean's when they just utter each other's name disdainfully  terry  danny  you can pick any number of jack's performances dating as far back as five easy pieces in the diner to a few good men and his court room interrogation scene  these guys just have it  you can add denzel washington to the small and exclusive list of actors who exudes that terrific trait in everything he does  if you look at some of his explosive borderline diatribes in the siege to his impressive tribute to malcolm x in spike lee's film of the same name  you can see that there is no finer an actor working today  i don't mention all of this to insinuate that man on fire is perfect just because of denzel's work  but he is definitely the cog of the production  i was literally mesmerized with some of his scenes that are raw  emotional and incendiary all at the same time washington plays creasy a former spy or cia agent or one of those covert government operatives  he has pretty much hit rock bottom as he has become disillusioned with the life that he has led  he has killed and perhaps done things that are best left unsaid and this has made him a hardened and bitter man  his friend and perhaps mentor  played very reservedly by christopher walken  is living in mexico making a very comfortable living by providing body guard services for the rich  apparently the kidnapping business in mexico is so vibrant that these paid former s e a l s and such can do very well while providing a needed service  creasey needs the work and accepts a job with a well to do family who seems to be in some financial difficulty  marc anthony is fine as samuel  radha mitchell is tantalizingly sexy as his wife lisa and dakota fanning is just unbelievably and precociously brilliant as pita  i don't know how a child of her age can have such range to play the characters that she does but her interpretation of pita is nothing short of oscar worthy  the film's entire first half is dependent on the relationship between pita and creasy and if there was a weaker actress in the role  perhaps that emotional synergy would not have come across so succinctly  but fanning is nothing short of remarkable in the role it is the relationship between pita and creasy that drives this film to the apex of cinema  together they are perfect and there is a real bond developed between them  tony scott directs with a frenetic urgency and his eye for visual flare has never been better  i am interested to see how his next film  domino  turns out  i think scott is one of today's under rated directors and with more films like this one  his name will surely be elevated to icon status the story has creasy really taking to pita  and visca versa  there is a definite connection between the two of them and perhaps it stems from the fact that although pita loves her dad  he is not around much  he is a philanthropist and obviously has little time to spend with his family  soon  creasy is taking pita to her swimming competition  he is reading her bedtime stories and she is naming her teddy bear creasy it's not just a friendship between them  it is more of a kinship  and a deep parental love seems to be present  the film changes gears when pita does get kidnapped and held for ransom and creasy is is almost fatally injured trying to protect her  this is where the story becomes thick with innuendo and ripe with deceit as the plot pieces get unraveled like an onion  and this is where denzel becomes a tour de force  like i said earlier  i have seen denzel give some outstanding performances in films like crimson tide and training day  but never have i seen him like this  he is a man possessed and with the possibility of pita being dead  he becomes a literal man on fire  it rages in him as he hunts down and dishes out his brand of comeuppance  denzel's anger and acerbity are ubiquitous and not easily quelled as he hunts down each person responsible for pita's violation  this all vigilante justice as the mexican authorities always seem to be one step behind  also what is paramount to this film's audacious brilliance is that there are few films that actually give the criminals their due comeuppance  i have often been frustrated to watch films where the bad guys get let off easily  they inflict all kinds of torment for the entire film and then they take a bullet and die  but not in this film  writer brian helgeland sees to it that retribution here is unequivocal and it is painful  the perpetrators here feel creasy's wrath and they experience the torment that he unleashes  there is nothing gimmicky about his brand of justice  he needs information and someone loses a finger  he wants answers and a homemade bomb is placed in places that are meant for other things  there is no punches pulled here and this is one of the true strengths of the film man on fire is one the five best films of now that it is out on dvd  my recommendation is to get the se  it is loaded with bonus features that include about hours of documentaries and different commentary tracks   ,0.9910146594047546,0,this comment does including baffles there are few actors that have an intangible to them that innate

be effective here  unlike stiller  or even steve martin both of whom use selfdeprecating humor very effectively kornbluth apparently has an ego that simply will not allow putting himself in that light  he seems to have a need to let his audience know that he  the real kornbluth  is in reality much more clever than kornbluth the character  and being unable to get past that does him in  as well as the film  rather than give the millions of office workers who may see this film someone to whom they can relate or with whom they can identify  kornbluth affects a condescending manner that only serves to alienate the very people he is attempting to reach  so what it all comes down to is a case of poor directing and unconvincing acting  and when you take into consideration that the screenplay itself was weak to begin with  with an inexplicably narrow focus given the potential of the rich subject matter  it's easy to understand why this one just doesn't fly  the one saving grace of the film is the performance by warren keith as shelby  whose subtle delivery is convincing  and which in and of itself is fairly humorous  the effectiveness of it is diminished  however  inasmuch as keith has to share his scenes with kornbluth  which somewhat automatically cancels out his positive contributions to the project  shumaker and sarah overman julie faustino also manage to keep their heads above water with their respective performances  which are commendable  if not entirely memorable  they at least make their scenes watchable  and overman even manages to elevate kornbluth's performance  if

himself to be effective here unlike stiller or even steve martin both of whom use selfdeprecating humor very effectively kornbluth apparently has an ego that simply will not allow putting himself in that light he seems to have a need to let his audience know that he the real kornbluth is in reality much more clever than kornbluth the character and being unable to get past that does him in as well as the film rather than give the millions of office workers who may see this film someone to whom they can relate or with whom they can identify kornbluth affects a condescending manner that only serves to alienate the very people he is attempting to reach so what it all comes down to is a case of poor directing and unconvincing acting and when you take into consideration that the screenplay itself was weak to begin with with an inexplicably narrow focus given the potential of the rich subject matter it's easy to understand why this anyone just doesn't fly the one saving grace of the film is the performance by warren keith as shelby whose subtle delivery is convincing and which in and of itself is fairly humorous the effectiveness of it is diminished however inasmuch as exmrs has to share his scenes with kornbluth which somewhat automatically cancels out his positive contributions to the project shumaker and sarah overman julie faustino also manage to keep their heads above water with their respective performances which are commendable if not entirely memorable they at least make their scenes watchable and overman even manages to elevate kornbluth's performance if only momentarily but it's still not enough to save the day or the film the supporting cast includes amy resnick mindy brian thorstenson clifford june lomena davonne joe bellan jimmy the mail clerk with a cameo appearance by a disheveled looking harry shearer as the orientation leader a function that begs for an answer to the question what was he thinking when he concurred to this ' in any work environment there will forever be situations arising that one way or another will unavoidably become fodder for someone's comedic cannon and the films depicting said situations will always be with us

movie starts with what can only be described as five minutes of scrolling text that may or may not be important  as after a minute passes  the audience stops caring and just sits through the rest

really can't follow with what is going on  characters move in and out of the plot like candy  some having huge buildups for meaningless deaths  basically  what i can understand is that some demons got released  and edward carnby  slater  has some link to them thanks to some operation given to children in his orphanage which has failed on him  he finds an artefact involving the demons and brings it to an exgirlfriend anthropologist  reid   who of course he manages to have sex with right away for no good reason  then  out of nowhere  all hell breaks loose  and the pair end up with a military team led by some asshole commander  dorff   who apparently has a mutual hatred for carnby it's all ridiculous  and the reason i don't really understand it isn't just because it's complicated and jumbled  but it leaves no room for anyone to really care  instead  i highly recommend that  if you must see this film  bring a tennis ball or something to occupy yourself when the plot manages to bore you into confusion the action scenes in a movie with a plot as terrible as this should at least bring it up a little  right  too bad  this movie is like any other ruined crap ever made  with enough quick cuts to behead a coop of chickens  considering that this is based on a horror game  not an action game  it is especially annoying the first action scene involving a man chasing cranby from a taxi is among the worst i have ever had to witness  and the rest isn't all that great either  the demons look somewhat cool  though the fact that they turn into powder when killed takes away all that effect  scenes involving lots of guns which should be cool to watch instead involve the muzzle fire as the only source of light and the camera zooming and panning faster than the head of a crack addict  it's all the kind of seizure inducing crap that keeps children in bed at night the acting is what i like to call taking actors and making them do nothing  slater does nothing but sound important for the whole movie  though he does seem to have more talent than he is letting on  the same is true of dorff  who gets a thankless role despite actually having some talent something that has happened to him a lot  reid is pretty much exactly what she should be  background sex appeal  as whenever she tries to act it is a disaster as is the incredibly bad scientist look she has in the beginning in all  this is the type of movie that worries me about future video game movies  if they keep ruining the spirit like this  it's only a matter of time before samus aran is killing middleeasterns with an ak and tommy vercetti is fighting a squadron of aliens  unlike resident evil  however  this one doesn't deserve a second chance  as i don't think anything could possibly help me forget just how terrible this movie is  it's bland  uninteresting and unexciting  this is the movie equivalent of diarrhea  it's all thrown together  nothing really fits and  in the end  you're just glad it's over total

of guns which should be cool to watch instead involve the muzzle fire as the only source of light and the camera zoom and panning faster than the head of a crack addict it's all the kind of seizure inducing crap that keeps children in bed at nocturnal the acting is what i like to call taking actors and making them do nada slater does nothing but sound important for the whole films though he does seem to have more talent than he is letting on the same is true of dorff who gets a thankless role despite actually having some talent something that has happened to him a lot red is pretty much exactly what she should be background sex appeal as whenever she attempt to act it is a catastrophes as is the incredibly bad scientist look she has in the beginning in all this is the type of movie that disturbs me about future video game movies if they keep wreck the spirit like this it's only a matter of time before samus aran is killing middleeasterns with an ak and tommy vercetti is combats a squadron of aliens exmrs resident evil however this one doesn't deserve a second chance as i don't think anything could possibly help me forget just how terrible this movie is it's bland inconsequential and unexciting this is the movie equivalent of diarrhea it's all thrown together nothing genuinely fits and in the ending you're just glad it's over

1,lately i have been watching a lot of tom hanks films and old chaplin films and even some of rowan atkinson's early bean performances  and it seems that all of them have their own unique charm that permeates throughout their work  something that allows them to identify with audience members of all ages  in a way that just makes you feel good  a bug's life has that same charm  it has a connection with real life that allows us to easily suspend disbelief and accept a lot of talking insects  because even though they talk  they still act just like real bugs  it's like the team that made the movie found a way to bring us into the mind of a child and allow us to think like them  to imagine bugs the way a young mind does honey  i shrunk the kids was one of my favorite films when i was younger  and to me  a bug's life is like a more realistic version of that movie  if only because the animation is so breathtaking and this style of storytelling just opens up so many more narrative possibilities  i try not to compare it to something like toy story which i still maintain is the best computer animated film ever made  because the story of a bug's life is not quite as good as toy story's  but then again  almost nothing is  the important thing is that it is still wonderful fun  the story concerns a colony of hard working bugs who have an impressively developed society  mostly geared around building a harvest of food  most of which will go to the tyrannical grasshoppers  vastly superior in strength and general meanness  and hopefully still leave enough left over for the bugs to make it through the winter  we are treated to some visits from the grasshoppers  who make it clear that if the bugs provide an unsatisfactory quantity of food  the consequences will be dire  and incidentally  the similarities between this crippling level of food extraction is strikingly similar to mao tsetung's vicious forcing of food from his own people during the great leap forward the fun and excitement begins when flik  the main character  sets off on a quest to find a gang of appropriate warrior bugs to come back and help defend the colony against the grasshoppers  you see  he spilled all of the amassed food and placed everyone in great danger  so he feels it's his responsibility  but he inadvertently ends up hiring a struggling group of insect circus performers  great for the audience  not so great for the safety of the clan  the movie was released back in the late s  when so many films seemed to have been coming out in twos  like armageddon and deep impact  independence day and the arrival  a bug's life and antz  etc  comparisons between a bug's life and antz are inevitable  although it seems clear to me that a bug's life is by far the superior film  and not only because it doesn't star woody allen stuttering and whining through the lead role  this is great family fun ,0.9934870004653932,1,lately i have been watching a lot of tom hanks films and old

there for exposition  get around to telling us what is going on or whatever  there's little point to care  the filmmaking is shoddy i e  the degree rule is broken many times over and not in a

1,this movie was an impressive one  my first experience with a foreign film  it was neither too long  nor too complex  i myself enjoyed the subtitles  and the plot was surprisingly fresh  the story of an adult son visiting his elderly father and retarded brother after a long separation appeared cliched at first  but it proved to be very touching and realistic  there was also some subtle humor so as not to depress or bore the audience ,0.984449565410614,0,this movie was an impressive anyone my first experience with a alien film it was neither too long nor too convoluted i myself enjoyed the subtitle and the plot was astonishingly costs the story of an mature son visiting his ancient father and retarded brother after a long separating seemed cliched at first but it proved to be very touch and realistic there was also some perceptive humor so as not to depress or bore the audience,0.4926465451717377,12,0.895040369088812,Y,0.16
0,you know  i really have a problem with movie lists  i was reading maxim magazine a while ago and they had a list of the greatest bmovies of all time  and knowing me  i of course have to go through and watch them all and write reviews of all of them  this is why you see reviews of movies like gator bait and barb wire and coffy on my list  so i noticed h o t s  at the video store the other day and recognized it from maxim's list of the greatest bmovies  and i decided to rent it and check it out  my only consolation is that i rented it because i recognized it from a list of bmovies  so i already knew it was going to suck  given the type of movie that it is  i can't say that h o t s  is a total failure  since it is nothing more than a late s t film  and it never pretends to by anything else  the only place where it strays widely from its objective is in a ragged subplot involving a couple of excons who have stashed a lot of stolen money in the house that the selfnamed h o t s  move in to  because this subplot has absolutely no place in the movie  despite the fact that the rest of the movie is as well  this subplot is completely superfluous and unnecessary  the story is based on a couple of rival sororities at the beloved f u  which exists as one of those universities that contains a grand total of one sorority until the rejects form their own in order to get back at the snobs in the other one  this new sorority  help out the seals h o t s   is a sorority supposedly based on helping seals the seal subplot is another one that doesn't really belong in the movie  and little attention is paid to the meaning of that name beyond having a seal running around here and there throughout the movie  this is going to sound weird  but there was actually one scene that i was pretty impressed with in this movie  one shot that i was impressed with  i should say  about midway through the movie  one of the girls in pi  the rival sorority  is pouring alcohol into the punch  and she pours some for herself in a glass and drinks it  oddly enough  what she does as she drinks that alcohol reminds me of something that charlie chaplin would do  which really brightened up the movie  obviously  nothing in this movie comes close to anything that chaplin ever did  but that shot alone raised my score for the movie from a to a as a whole  however  the movie is exactly what you would expect it to be  a lot of people running around looking for excuses to take off their clothes i liked how the removeonepieceofclothingforeveryscore in the football game at the end was one of the girls' ideas  riiiiiiiiight   and not much thought is put into much of anything else  there is  for example  a scene early in the film when a couple of the pi girls pour hot sauce into the refreshments at a h o t s  party  accidentally getting caught in an incriminating photograph the girl taking the picture didn't realize that she photographed them at the time  although the photograph never comes up for any reason later in the film  i've seen movies like this before  it's kind of like gator bait but without the violence and the rednecks and coffy wasn't far off  even barb wire is much the same  just with a bigger budget and more silicon  thankfully  maxim's bmovie list contains only a few more comedies  because while these cheesy teen t films are entertaining every once in a while as bad movies with the occasional seminude scene  after watching h o t s  i think i've decided that i like the bad horror movies better than the bad comedies  i'd rather watch a lot of terrible actors pretend to be scared than pretend to be funny ,0.035415396094322205,1,you know i really have a problem with films listings i was reading maxim magazine a while ago and they had a listings of

1,daisy movie review by james mudge from beyondhollywood comon paper  daisy sounds like an asian film fan's dream come true  directed by infernal affairs cohelmer andrew lau and starring everybody's favourite sassy girl  popular korean actress jeon ji hyun  unfortunately  despite the talent involved  and the fact that the crew flew halfway around the world to shoot in amsterdam  the film turns out to be a bit of a disappointment  being a clich'd romantic drama which wallows in misery and self importance the plot follows hye young jeon ji hyun  a rather naive korean girl who lives in amsterdam  spending her life working in her grandfather's antique shop and doing portraits for tourists  one day  she begins receiving flowers at exactly the same time from a secret admirer  who she believes to be a mystery man from her past who once built her a nice little bridge  one day she meets jeong woo lee seong jae  also in holiday and public enemy  who unbeknownst to her is actually an interpol agent tracking asian criminals in the netherlands with hye young assuming that jeong woo is responsible for the flowers  the two fall very slowly into a chaste romantic relationship  however  it turns out that the man sending the flowers is actually park yi jung woo sung  from sad movie and musa  an assassin working for a chinese crime syndicate  inevitably  the love triangle turns tragic and the two men end up facing off while poor hye young tries to work out which of the two is the love of her life although daisy is ostensibly a love story  it has the feel of a funeral  with a slow  sombre pace and a plot which piles on the misery  half of the film's running time is taken up with scenes of the characters staring longingly out of windows into the rain  with the silence broken only by bouts of self pitying narration  director lau seems to be under the impression that the film is a weighty shakespearean tragedy  rather than yet another gloomy hitman love story  as such  the proceedings have a rather pretentious air  despite the fact that the plot is inherently predictable and based largely around glaring cliché borrowed liberally from the likes of fulltime killer and john woo's classic the killeralmost every aspect of the film is riddled with angst  with the three lead characters suffering as if the weight of the world was on their shoulders  and steadfastly refusing to do anything to pursue their romantic inclinations  park yi in particular  as the kind of overly emotional  socially retarded assassin so beloved of modern cinema  is faintly ludicrous  from his blatant incompetence on the job to his hilarious attempts to discuss impressionist painting with hye young or his penchant for flower growing  this languid passivity does make the film's central romance somewhat hard to swallow  and lau's attempts to evoke the feeling that it is fate which brings the characters together comes across more as shoddy coincidence fans of jeon ji hyun should note that her character is far closer to her role in the glum supernatural drama the uninvited than my sassy girl or windstruck and while she tries her best to pull a few wacky faces here and there  her performance is certainly more subdued the film benefits from glossy production values  and lau makes good use of the amsterdam scenery  playing on the contrast between the grey  almost gothic beauty of the city and the innocent blue skies and flowery fields of the countryside  unfortunately  he tends to overuse slow motion for some of the emotional scenes  which when coupled with some of the picture postcard visuals gives the film the feel at times of a perfume advert  there are a few scenes of surprisingly violent action  though these are few and far between  and whilst well staged  seem to have been thrown in as an afterthought and do little more than briefly raising the pulse despite its flaws  daisy makes for engaging viewing  and the story grips almost in spite of itself  mainly out of a morbid fascination to see not which of the men hye young will end up with  but to see who will lie dying in her arms  the self indulgent melodrama works well enough to tick all the right boxes for the genre  and the film functions perfectly well as an enjoyably glossy  weepy romance it is worth noting that the dvd features the director's cut of the film  which for once indicates that it is substantially different from the theatrical version  which not only adds minutes  but reorders some of the scenes  making the narrative less linear  although this new version is perhaps too long  it is surely superior  as without these changes  the film would surely have been even more conventional and would have suffered from even murkier character development wai keung lau

0,currently  this film is listed on imdb as the nd worst film ever madewhich is exactly why i rented it from netflix  however  i am saddened to report that the film  while bad  is no where near bad enough to merit being in the bottom films ever made list  i have personally seen at least films worse than this one  hardly a glowing endorsement  but it just didn't meet the expected level of awfulness to be included on this infamous list the film begin with stewart moss and marianne mcandrew on their belated honeymoon by the way  they are married in real life as well  he's a doctor who is obsessed with bats and insists they go to a nearby cave  once there  they behave very  very  very stupidly hallmark of a bad film and are soon bitten by a bat  according to this film  bats love to attack people and there are vampire bats in the usboth of which are not true at all oddly  after being bitten  the man doesn't even bother going to the hospital  the first thing on anyone's mind especially a doctor is to get medical help immediately  but not this boob  soon  he's having seizuresyet he still isn't interested in seeking help  again and again you keep thinking that this must be the stupidest couple in film history  after a while  he eventually goes to see a doctor and is sent to the hospital  but  by then it's too late and his attacks become more violent and he begins killing people to suck their blood  when it's totally obvious to everyone that the man is a crazed killing machine  the wife who  like her husband  has a grapefruit for a brain refuses to believe he's dangerouseven after he attacks people  steals an ambulance and runs a police car off the road  now most of the time moss is going through these episodes  his eyes roll back and he looks like a normal person  oddly  however  a couple times he develops batlike hands and towards the end they used some nice prosthetics on him to make him look quite batlike  had this been really cheesy  the film would have merited a in the very end  in a twist that hardly made any sense at all  the wife inexplicably turned into a crazed bat lady and had a swarm of bats kill the evil sheriff  how all this was arranged was a mystery as was moss' and mcandrew's belief that this film would somehow help their careersthough they both have had reasonably long careers on tv playing bit roles since overall  very dumb  the plot is silly and makes no sense and strongly relies on people acting way too dumb to be real  not a good film at all  but not among the worst films of all time either note  for some reason  imdb shows the graphic for the three dvd set for it's alive and it's two sequels of the web page for the bat people  while the bat people has been seen with the title it's alive the two movies are not

replace adam when he was leaving the series  the cast had chemistry  and they seemed to genuinely like each other  that made many of their weakest stories work a lot better than they should have  it also made many of their best stories into great western drama like any show that was shooting over thirty episodes every season  there are bound to be some weak ones  however  most of the time each episode had an interesting story  some kind of conflict  and a resolution that usually did not include violence  while bonanza was a western  the gunfighting was never featured as the main attraction  while i am a fan of the rifleman and wante dead or alive  those shows usually ended with a gunfight  gunfights were how many westerns resolved every conflict  and bonanza was very different in trying to seek peaceful resolutions and harmony instead of killing in the early years of bonanza  there are some interesting episodes that do feature a lot of gunfights  those episodes stand in contrast to the rest of the series  but they are pretty good in and of themselves  in when pernell whitaker wanted to leave the show  guy williams was brought in to replace him  williams was playing the role of a longlost cousin  unfortunately  whitaker decided to stay one more year  and thus williams was written out of the series when he moved away to marry adam's old girlfriend  if williams had stayed on for the duration of bonanza  one can only wonder how much better the series would have been in the years after when pernell whitaker left the show undoubtedly  once pernell whitaker left the series  the stories focused more on comedy and country hijinks  whitaker had often played the heavy in many episodes  and his absence left a void in the cast  little joe always wanted to play the nice kid  and hoss always wanted to play the good old boy with a heart of gold  since ben was the kind and wise patriarch of the family  that did not leave too much room for any gunfights at some point they hired a ranch hand called candy david canary who became their fourth member of the cast  but candy was never featured in any gunfights  and he was hardly more than an older version of little joe  for a year or two they also had ben take in some other lost cousin jamie  played by the forgettable mitch vogel who was a teenager that was usually getting into some kind of trouble with someone apparently by adding the teenager  the studio was looking to attract younger viewers  it also gave the writers a chance to write episodes about teenage problems  alcohol  delinquency  etc  those kind of preachy episodes were popular in the s as a reaction of the establishment media to the counterculture movement  dragnet was probably the most popular source of law and order tv  though hawaii the f b i  and many other shows also tried to jump on the bandwagon by doing tv shows that featured irresponsible teenagers causing mischief  mayhem  and crime the addition of a teenager to the cast gave the cartwrights more chances to show up and solve problems  but those episodes feel very contrived and are not very good in general  after dan blocker died  the series limped along for another year or so before it was canceled  the last season was pretty bad  as it featured little joe tracking down the killers of his wife  and most of the episodes were somewhat depressing because little joe was usually drinking or otherwise remembering how much he loved his wife  and how unfair it was that she was killed i don't think i have ever seen the last episode of the series  and i wonder if they ever officially wrapped it up in some way  by the last year  there was only ben lorne greene actually living on the ponderosa  as adam had moved away and never came back even once as a guest and hoss had died and little joe had left after his wife in the series had been killed by drifters overall  the era from is the best of this series  once adam left  it slowly declined  most of the shows before are pretty good too  by the series was trying to hard to be hip and topical  and it had lost a lot of its western flavor  the addition of candy and the teenage kid also diluted the general quality of the

1,first of all  the release date is not for this feature length nature documentary film  it should be more properly referred to as  earth   secondly  allow me to address the complaints of some reviewers who have seen the planet earth tv series of i have not seen this tv series  but learned here  that this film is the full length version of this tv series  i judge any film  on it's own merits  not by it's source  i judge the results  on their own  and the results of earth   are indeed excellent  i dismiss this trivial complaint of some reviewers  that it's simply an expanded version of the tv series planet earth so what  it doesn't really matter as a film buff and one who has viewed dozens of nature documentaries in my lifetime  i was astonished and highly impressed by earth   this is the debut film from the new disneynature division of disney and follows in the footsteps of walt disney's pioneering and academy award winning nature documentary films of the 's and 's cinematography  film editing  music score  sound and narration are all excellent  there have been a few other nature documentaries that also excelled in these categories  what really sets earth   apart is its' scope  it literally covers the entire planet  covering all seven continents after my first viewing  it was obvious this documentary film required a massive effort and amount of time and talent to create  three production companies were required to make this amazing documentary film earth   convincingly tells the stories of four species on their great migrations as it spans one year through the seasons beginning in january and ending in december  from the north pole to the south pole two special new hightech cameras were used for this film  one camera has a degree computer controlled motorized rotating lens and the other is a hd camera set to an amazing frames per second  this filming technique really added drama and beauty to some of the scenes of earth   especially the cheetah chase and great white sharks leaping out of the water to catch sea lions and an aerial view going over the edge of the world's highest waterfall  there are many stunningly beautiful shots in this documentary via cinematography  music score and narration  there is drama  sadness  humor and great beauty in this documentary  with a great music score performed by the world renowned berliner philharmoniker  excellent creative and technical cinematography and james earl jones narration  i consider earth   as the greatest nature feature length documentary film ever made five years of hard work  patience  talent and dedication really paid off very well here  this film should be required viewing in all schools throughout the world  i predict an academy award for best documentary

series of i have not watched this tv series but learned here that this movie is the utter length version of this televisions series i deem any movies on it's own merited not by it's source i judge the results on their own and the results of earth are admittedly excellent i dismisses this trivial complaint of some tellers that it's mere an expanded version of the tv series planet earth so what it doesn't really issue as a film buff and one who has viewed tens of nature documentaries in my lifetime i was astonished and highly astonishing by earth this is the debut film from the new disneynature division of pixar and persisted in the footsteps of walt disney's pioneering and academy award wins characters literature films of the 's and 's cinematography film editing music score sound and narration are all terrific there have been a few other character documentaries that also excelled in these categories what truthfully sets earth besides is its' scope it virtually cover the entire planet covering all seven continents after my upfront viewing it was obvious this documentation film required a colossal endeavour and amount of moment and don to create three production companies were necessary to make this startling literature film earth convincingly tells the stories of thirdly species on their great migrations as it spans eden yrs through the seasons beginning in jan and ending in december from the north masts to the south pole two special new hightech cameras were used for this film one cam has a grade pc overseen motorized rotating lens and the other is a hd camcorder set to an amazing frames per secondly this filming technique really added drama and beauty to some of the scenes of earth especially the cheetah chase and phenomenal white shark leaping out of the mar to catch sea lions and an aerial view disappearing over the edge of the world's highest waterfall there are many strikingly beautiful shots in this documentary via cinematography music score and narration there is drama sadness comic and great beauty in this literature with a great music score performed by the world renowned berliner philharmoniker excellent creative and technical cinematography and james earl jones narration i consider earth as the greatest nature feature length documentary film ever introduced five years of harsh work patience knack and dedication really pays off very alright here this film should be necessary view in all faculties during the globally i predicted an academy award for best documentary feature among other awards truly an amazing astonishing

1,i really thought that this movie was superb  not only is the history correct  but the style is sumptuous and yet intimate  i was a fan of emily blunt's portrayal of victoria and how she kept her spirit even though she was forced into a virtual exile while in her youth  blunt depicts the charismatic and sometimes dogmatic manner that vicotria became famous perhaps infamous for  the romantic elements of the movie are so genuine and tender that by the end of the movie you genuinely understand why vicotria chose to live the rest of her days in mourning of albert the technical aspects of the film are worthy of note as well  i appreciated the beautiful score  which moves quite wonderfully along with the dramatic movement of the story  i also considered the cinematography to be outstanding  some scenes leaving me quite breathless because of the lushness and splendor they depict there have been so few movies this year as beautiful and tender as this film and it rates as one of 's best ,0.9940775632858276,1,i really thought that this film was splendid not only is the story correct but the style is wondrous and however comfy i was a venting of emilie blunt's descriptions of triumphs and how she persists her gist also notwithstanding she was forced into a evilness expulsion while in her youth brutish outlined the exmrs and seldom unorthodox shape that vicotria became proverbial maybe ignominious for the romances ingredients of the film are so truthful and submission that by the terminating of the films you frankly understand why vicotria choose to live the rest of her days in mourning of albert the techniques aspects of the films are praiseworthy of observes as allright i appreciated the ravishing footnote which move very splendidly along with the phenomenal movement of the stories i also deemed the cinematography to be extraordinaire some pictures leaving me totally breathless because of the lushness and magnificence they illustrate there have been so few filmmaking this year as marvellous and bid as this movie and it fares as one of 's best,0.8558226823806763,57,0.7452322738386308,N,0.33

0,all right  let's be realistic about this  nobody goes into a movie produced by wwe films whose owner has challenged god to a wrestling match  directed by a former porn director the man gave the world the between the cheeks trilogy  starring a wrestler named kane  and expects a little slice of art on a golden platter  if you do then you probably need to find something other than watching movies to occupy your time so what exactly are we to expect from a movie like this  well  here's what i was looking forward to  bad acting   a fairly nonexistent  clichéd storyline   kane walking around with a scrunched  sour face that indicates his nostrils just found the potato salad he misplaced a month ago   tons and tons of gore  well  if you're hungry for some so bad it's funny entertainment then this might satisfy your appetite because it delivers on all counts obviously  movies like this are best seen for free  but if you do choose to sacrifice box office bucks then have some fun and make a game out of it  the filmmakers are nice enough to introduce us to each of the annoying delinquents by flashing their names and legal offenses on the screen  this makes it easier for you to write down which ones you want to see killed and in what order  you and your friends can see whose predictions are most accurate i also suggest that you and your pals write down every single moment of stupidity and inanity that you can find  tally them up at the end and see who comes up with the most  i think my grand total was  can you beat that  i personally want to know how

0,disney has now made straighttovideo sequels to a good bunch of their many animated features  two of these were made for their classic  beauty and the beast well  these ones aren't really sequels  as they are both set in between the events of the first film  the first of these two straighttovideo films was beauty and the beast  the enchanted christmas which seems to be disliked by quite a few fans of its theatrical predecessor  but i think that can usually be expected with sequels  however  this second one  belle's magical world is definitely inferior the film features three short stories  all of which take place while belle is in the castle  and the place is under the spell of the enchantress  the first is the perfect word where a misunderstanding at the table between belle and the beast leads to trouble  and neither wants to be the first to apologize  the next story is fifi's folly where fifi and lumiere's fifth anniversary is coming up  and lumiere is unprepared  so belle helps him  however  fifi sees lumiere practicing romance with belle  and thinks they're actually in love  the film ends with the broken wing in this story  belle takes care of a bird with a broken wing  but a bird in the castle will probably mean trouble if the beast finds out  as he hates birds  the plot description i gave is for the original vhs version of disney's third beauty and the beast movie  apparently  in the dvd version  there is another story added called mrs  potts's party but i've only seen the original version  however  since i highly doubt that one story would stand out as a classic over the rest  i see no point in watching the special edition  anyway  the first thing i will say about belle's magical world is that the animation is very dimensional compared to what we're used to from disney  which would obviously disappoint many people  i didn't like beauty and the beast  the enchanted christmas that much  but you certainly can't say the same about its animation  i'm sure the stories in belle's magical world could entertain many kids mostly younger ones  i think  and each story has a moral  so they could also teach them some valuable lessons  however  for adults  the film really doesn't have a lot  i personally didn't find any good humour in it  found that the constant conflict between belle and the beast got tiring  and the stories did not impress me too much at all in any way they're not very well written  in the perfect word the way belle says to the beast  you're acting rude  and foolish  is a bit cheesy  and i think there are quite a few other cheesy moments in these stories by the time this straighttovideo movie first came out  i was around eleven or twelve years old  i don't know what i would have thought of it at the time  as i had lost interest in disney by then  and it would be years before i would gain any of that interest back  even when this movie was first released  i think i was a bit past the age group it was aimed at  i never saw beauty and the beast  the enchanted christmas until a couple months ago  but unlike that film  i never even heard of this one until recently  i think just after seeing the first sequel to disney's hit  well  as much as i like the theatrical original  i wouldn't have been missing much if i never became aware of this film's existence  for little kids  i'm sure belle's magical world can be highly entertaining  and probably somewhat educational with its morals  but i do not recommend it for adult disney fans ,0.20699873566627505,1,disney has now made straighttovideo sequels to a good bunch of their many animated features two of these were made for their classic beauty and the beast well these ones aren't really sequels as they are both set in between the events of the first film the first of these two straighttovideo films was beauty and the beast the enchanted christmases which seems to be disliked by quite a few fans of its theatrical predecessor but i think that can usually be expected with sequels however this second one belle's magical world is definitely bottom the film features three short stories all of which take place while belle is in the castle and the place is under the spell of the enchantress the first is the perfect word where a misunderstanding at the table between belle and the beast leads to trouble and neither wants to be the first to apologize the next story is fifi's folly where fifi and lumiere's fifth anniversary is coming up and lumiere is unable so belle helps him however fifi sees lumiere practicing romance with belle and

on a girl's chest and to include the hilarious line  it smells like someone farted out here  the characters have no personality or depth and they do some of the most moronic things ever seen in a horror movie  somewhere along the way  the characters also magically transform into a swat team to take down the zombies  it's like they don't even have to aim their guns and they automatically shoot the zombies in the head the scariest thing by far about this movie is the directing  there is something wrong with uwe boll  boll's camera work is astonishingly disjointed  his pans to zombies running through the forest are more silly than menacing  worse yet  boll actually thought it would be a good idea to include small bits of footage from the house of the dead video game into the movie  quite often  and at the most random times  you will suddenly see an animated zombie getting shot  it makes no sense  no one in their right mind would think that was a good idea  it's like boll wants to remind us repeatedly that this movie is supposed to be based on the video game  uwe boll also decided it would be cool to include slow motion degree rotating shots during the action scenes  a la 'the matrix' unfortunately  he does it way too often and each shot is nauseating  the soundtrack to this movie also boggles the mind  most action scenes are accompanied by loud rap track  this also adds to the ensuing headaches caused by the atrocious 'house of the dead''house of the dead' isn't bad because it's based on a video game  in fact  it has very little to do with the video game  it also does not fit into the category of 'so bad that it's good' it does however fit into the category of 'so bad that it's painful' this movie just plain sucks  uwe boll should never be let anywhere near another

take itself very seriously doesn't help  if i have to listen to charlotte rampling go on about how intelligent killer whale's are just one more time i'll scream  i'm sorry but i simply don't believe a killer whale is intelligent enough to know who any particular boat belongs to  sink it  i don't believe a killer whale can cause a huge explosion including knocking an oil lantern from a wall on the

that are as strong as this dumb film makes out  maybe i'm being a bit harsh  i mean it's only a film after all but it's a film which is trying to be serious  things just got so ridiculous that i was half expecting the killer whale to write a letter to nolan to tell him his plan  hand or should that be fin  deliver it  the thing seemed intelligent enough to do just about anything else  they should have asked it to come up with a cure for the common cold  seriously  that's a statement that's no more far fetched than anything else in this film  i found the film very boring  totally dull  had awful character's with no on screen presence at all  it goes without saying this is a jaws  ripoff which doesn't even come close to spielberg's classic director anderson is no spielberg that's for sure  this rubbishy film has absolutely no suspense  scares  tension or atmosphere at all  all the attack scenes are as dull as dishwater  totally forgettable  there's no build up to them  virtually no pay off either as orca doesn't get to eat a single person  then there's the scenes which literally had me laughing  the shots of the killer whale appearing to cry are pure comedy  the opening scenes of the two killer whales i suspect tried to show them as a 'loving'  'caring' couple but i couldn't help but think that this is the closest we'll ever get to killer whale porn  hilarious stuff  the footage of the killer whales themselves is bland  boring  instead of footage which matches  enhances the scenes around it it just looks like dreary wildlife documentary footage that has little

0,i picked this movie up because it sounded like a pretty decent flick  and i've always been a fan of foreign films  however  for someone who likes movies  i was surprised at how much i hate  hate  hated this movie although it does aim to expose the lives of young  lowerclass men in lima  and to an extent it does succeeed  the characters are hopelessly shallow and the audience winds up having absolutely no feelings whatsoever for them although the story chiefly revolves around m  he rarely ever speaks  and his dialouge is  at best  amazingly dry and dull  warning  some small spoilers basically  the story revolves around a young man named m who has been searching for jobs  but without success he does gain employment twice  but quits because they're not for him when you're poor  the last option you have is to be picky  some amount of time is spent with his friends  who's idea of fun is to rape a little year old  steal crappy tires off a piece of shit car for a dime sack of weed  and several other slightly retarded activities m's friend comesup with a plan to make  a piece and move to the us by running cocaine to miami  when the drug lord gives them a job  we're treated to an extremely lame scene of the three friends buying clothes at the mall with some music playing in the background  we see them trying different clothes on like little girls given  to shop  get there hair

there are numerable areas where the film is arguably vastly superior certainly  many of the comments are valid with regard to particular areas of the miniseries  specifically regarding more threads

in love with a woman of the night we all know pretty woman is a chick flick but you can't avoid them all  they'll eventually get you  pretty woman for me does two things  two terrible horrible ghastly things  firstly it portrays prostitution as a career more akin to that of a dancer  you know with absolutely great friends  leg warmers lots of giggling  borrowing each others make up  you see in the reality of pretty woman the prostitute and this is a street walker prostitute we're talking about here  has a great life  she's healthy happy with only the occasional whimper to explain her predicament  my feeling is this 'happy hooker' type protagonist is a lot more palatable than an even nearly realistic character  which for me begs the question if you make a movie about a type of person but are too chicken scared to adorn that player with the characteristics familiar to that role then why do it  if i make a film about a chef but don't want him to cook or talk about food or wear a white hat then why make a film about a chef in the first place  by bailing out and turning the hooker into a respectable dancer type the story misses the point completely and consequently never indulges in any of the moral or social questions that it could have  what a cop out  really really lame  secondly  'pretty woman' insults romance itself  edward lewis played by richard gere has no clue how to seduce or romance this 'lady' that is without his plastic friend  yep don't leave home without it  especially if you are a moron in a suit who has no imagination  out of of his romantic moments involve splashing cash in one way or another  even when he first meets her it's the lotus esprit turbo that does all the work  necklaces here diamonds there limos over there  money money money

0,i remember seeing the very first trailer for underdog back last march  i also remember at the time smiling to myself ever so slightly  sure it was a cheesy idea  but i genuinely thought at the time the concept might work  hell it couldn't be any worse than the disappointing cats and dogs could it  then by december and i suddenly remembered the film i realised how likely the film was to suck  the fact it had been delayed in the uk made it seem inevitable it would be terrible  but the horrendous reviews just made me realise it was nigh on impossible for the movie to be any good  still i swallowed my feelings and went to see the film with a friend today  as i entered my screen i was mortified  it was the very first time i'd be seeing a movie with a friend and being the only two in the screen  little did i know for what i was about to endure  underdog to put it blunt is horrendous  it really is  imagine how bad you could think this movie is and then prepare yourself for a movie even worse  that is just how pathetic the movie is  while it aims to entertain kids it just seems an embarrassing mess that seems to insult kids rather than allow them to enjoy the movie  matters cannot be helped by the fact that the story is beyond lacklustre  the acting is generally poor  and the movie just feels like an overlong  tired and downright boring saturday cartoon  after a brief five minutes where i thought the movie might be passable the movie just suddenly seems to die and then limp on towards the already sign posted finale  i'm just amazed the movie was actually ever released  it's an embarrassment to disney  hell half their straight to video sequels are better than this  what's even more terrifying is the fact the ending leaves room for a sequel so lets get onto the acting cracks knuckles  okay let me be honest jason lee is decent  his voice suits the canine  and had he have been given a decent script he might have made the performance work  however  with such a dodgy script he just seems to flounder  in many ways it reminded me of bill murray in garfield  murray did what he could with what he had  but what he had wasn't enough to make it passable  then we get onto the human actors  and well the majority of atrocious  alex neuberger plays the friend of underdog  jack  my biggest concern is that anybody would even take him seriously in an audition  the scene where he gets to fly with underdog is perhaps the most cringe worthy scene in the past few years just because his acting is so poor  not once did i believe he was a real person  in fact part of me is still convinced he was a robot made specially for the movie  james belushi seems half dead in the film  he has nothing to work with  no decent lines  he just seems to wander around the set waiting to become relevant to the plot  which the writers try to do towards the end but do it in such a poor way its laughable  thankfully peter dinklage is the one redeeming factor of the movie  he is great as dr barsinister and seems to be having a laugh in the role  he steals every scene he is in  although that's hardly difficult when he shares screen time with the extremely annoying patrick warburton  the rest of the cast are even worse  especially taylor momsen  she just needs to end her acting career right now underdog also fails dramatically in terms of delivering anything like a funny scene  when the funniest scene involves underdog biting a can and causing dog food to explode everywhere you know there is something drastically wrong  this could be easily ignored if the movie had decent action or a good story  alas the movie is even worse in both of these terms  the effects are so ropey that any scene where underdog flies just seems absurd  and the dog uses his powers to such little effect that you frequently forget he has superpowers  what's the point in making a film about a super dog if the damned dog never appears super  the final fight also verges on embarrassing purely because its ten minutes of nothingness  the dog flies  other stuff happens  some stuff gets chucked about  all of this is irrelevant as this stuff is happening for the sake of stuff happening  the script as well is dodgy at best and downright pain inducingly awful at worst  when someone says look its a plane  no its a bird  no its a frog   yes you read that right  i just wanted to burst into tears there and then  actually i wanted to walk out by remained compelled to see whether it could get any lower than that point  this happens near the end so it doesn't thankfully overall underdog becomes the worst movie of at this early period  and is actually just as bad as last years epic movie  luckily for underdog  meet the spartans arrives over here soon and i expect that to be even worse  so in case you didn't get the point of my review  avoid the film at all costs  if you want to see a movie with a dog then watch cats and dogs  buy a real dog if necessary  just do not see this ,0.002581823617219925,0,i remember seeing the very first trailer for underdog returning last marta i also remember at the time smiling to myself ever so slightly confident it was a dorky thought but i truly thought at the moment the conceptions might work hell it couldn't be any worse than the disappointing cats and dogs could it then by december and i suddenly remembered the movie i realised how likely the film was to suck the fact it had been delayed in the britons brought it seem inevitable it would be appalling but the horrendous reviews just brought me realise it was nigh on impossible for the movie to be any well nevertheless i swallowed my feelings and became to consults the film with a friend hoy as i entered my pant i was mortified it was the very first time i'd be seeing a movie with a friend and being the only two in the screen little did i soaps for what i was about to endure underdog to put it blunt is horrendous it really is imagine how bad you would think this film is and then develop yourself for a movie even worse that is just how pathetic the movie is while it aims to entertain kids it just appears an embarrassing mess that seems to insult children quite than allow them to enjoy the movies matters cannot be helped by the fact that the story is beyond lacklustre the behaving is generally indigent and the movie just feels like an overlong tired and entirely boring sunday cartoon after a succinct vs minutes where i thought the films might be everchanging the movie just sharply seems to died and then limp on for the already sign posted finale i'm just amazed the movie was really ever released it's an embarrassment to disney hell half their straight to video sequels are better than this what's even more terrifying is the fact the ending leaves room for a sequel so lets get onto the acting cranks toes okay leave me be candid jason lei is decent his voice clothes the canine and had he have been given a decent script he might have made the performance work yet with such a dodgy script he just seems to flounder in many ways it remind me of bill murray in garfield murray did what he could with what he had but what he had wasn't enough to

the fallen ones was a terrible film  it's as simple  straight forward as that  there are so many things that are just plain bad about the fallen ones both on a technical  conceptual level  the script doesn't make a whole lot of sense  it doesn't really get going until the final odd minutes by which time i had almost lost the will to live  the character's are awful  as clichéd as you like  the dialogue is bad as in very  very bad  the entire film is predictable  i mean it's not going to come as a surprise that casper van dien is going to save the day is it  it's not a huge surprise that the mummified giant is going to come back to life either so why wait until over an hour into the film when most of the audience will be in some sort of comatose state  this is bad  very bad  you have been warned director vanhook doesn't impress  the fight scenes are absolutely awful  why dress your bad guys up in a horrible shade of purple  they look naff  to give it a bit of credit the special effects on the giant mummy itself are actually good although there's not that many of them since he doesn't make an appearance for over an hour  there are also some normal sized mummy's that look to have come straight from the set of the mummy   unfortunately these aren't used to any great effect  in fact are wasted as some comic relief  the mechanical mummy was a pretty good idea but looked silly  there is no way on earth that all those people inside could work in sync with each other to operate it  actually the more i think about the more ridiculous the idea is  forget about any scares  tension or atmosphere  don't even think about any gore or violence because there isn't any technically the fallen ones isn't anything special  apart from the impressive giant mummy effects there's little her to get excited about  the ghost cgi  water effects are terrible  it was madefortv  it's shows  the acting was poor  wagner looks embarrassed  this is probably the only thing the likes of dien  bosley can

and does joe end up with susie  who loves him too the first and second times i saw anchors aweigh  i also saw it at the same time as i did on the town  the kelly  sinatra collaboration from both times i felt that anchors aweigh was the better film in terms of plotting and structureall the dances and songs fit the moment in the plot  and they develop the characters and story rather than hamper them  yet  both times i came away feeling that on the town is the better film overall  having now seen both films a third time  i still stand by that judgement  somehow on the town  as a film and a piece of entertainment  is just lighter  gayer  purely and simply happier the numbers are more outrageous and less integral to the plot  and yet somehow it works better than all the dances and singing in anchors aweigh  i'm not quite sure why this is  the typical argument is that the latter film is overlong  at almost two and a half hours  this is certainly a valid criticism to make  i certainly felt the length the first two times i saw it  however  it's also a film that grows on youthe more you see it  the shorter it feels and the more you appreciate the technical mastery involved in its making  and yet  something just doesn't hang together quite right  it feels almost as if the script was pored over  and every single moment when kelly could break into dance or sinatra into song was noted  and that's exactly what happened  no opportunity to shoehorn a musical number in was given up  and that's probably the film's biggest weakness  it has numbers give or take a few  and no matter how big a fan you are of kelly or sinatra  this really starts to turn one numb after a while  contrast this  for example  with the ten numbers in on the town  you might well feel that each song  each dance  can't be taken out of the film without leaving it lacking  and that's true  but that's also because the writers weren't more restrained in adding them in in the first place all this long preamble doesn't mean there's nothing good about anchors aweigh  the musical is splashy with great songs bursting out all over  like the duets between kelly and sinatra 'we hate to leave' 'i begged her' and 'if you knew susie'  the singing of sinatra 'what makes the sunset' 'the charm of you' and the best of all  'i fall in love too easily'  and without a doubt the always inventive  always breathtaking dancing of kelly  it's also hard to miss with a cast of this calibre  grayson is sweet and seems to improve on each viewing her voice becoming stunning rather than frightening jose iturbi's role is written sympathetically and he does a great job with it  even clarence's own brooklyn  pamela britton  is cute and charming  as close as one could get to betty garrett without being garrett herself  sinatra is adorable with those blue eyes and curls of his  and plays the innocent boyman wonderfully a role he reprises in on the town  his singing is  as usual  simply faultless from enunciation through to timing and phrasing  his solo numbers might seem to drag a little  but when you've got the voice of a century  showcasing it is probably as good a reason as any to slow up the rest of the film gene kelly's sheer genius in this film is worthy of its own paragraph  third in the billing behind sinatra and grayson respectively  anchors aweigh really is kelly's film  his joe brady is a believable  real characterhe's tough on the outside  glib and willing to lie when necessary to win a gal  but he's actually the biggest softy on the inside  kelly makes this charming rather than cloying  but also gives joe a real edge that you see in the scene when joe chases brooklyn around the room with a genuinely murderous look on his face and his breakfast tray in his hands  and the dancingagain  the film suffers from the 'too much of a good thing spoils the effect' syndrome  as it does with sinatra's singing  but once again  if it's gene kelly doing the softshoe  or tapping across the screen in a sailor's outfit or dressed up as a bandit chief  might as well err on the side of overdoing it  all of kelly's dances are breathtaking  be it the pareddown simplicity of his tap number with sinatra to 'i begged her' his 'mexican hat dance' with the sweet wideeyed little girl  or his lavish spanishinfluenced dance 'la cumparsita' of course  the classic image left in audiences' minds for all time would be kelly in his red  white and blue sailor suit  dancing with jerry mouse of 'tom  jerry' fame  a welldeserved golden film memory  to be sureit's not often that one can say you're impressed by the special effects in a film made in given the saturation of cgi in the contemporary film market  but gene and jerry still look great  with kelly always hitting his spots and looking exactly where he needs to look  it would turn out that just about the only people who could really keep up with gene kelly would be kelly himself in cover girl and a cartoon animation  it's doubtless that this first daring  inventive kelly dance with jerry has reserved a place for anchors aweigh in film history and the hearts of classic film buffs  but it's also notable for being the

0, i normally hate puns  but this seems the only appropriate summary for barnyard i suspect i am not the first  and i'm sure many  many comments focus on the idiocy of bulls with udders  it certainly bothered me right off the bat  but there's much more wrong with this movie than a fundamental lack of knowledge about how mammals work personally  if i was a parent  i would be irritated by the violent turn it takes near the end in the showdown with the coyotes  although for me  it at least injected a little action  and from a conventional screen writing point of view  you might expect the coyotes to play a greater role in the conflictgee you have a widow cow  maybe her husband was killed by coyotes  nope  there's a much dumber explanation  and what kind of a farm is this  otis vows to protect all the animals from harm  but there certainly seems to be no threat from humans  they make reference to the farmer being vegan  but what is he raising pigs for  in all children's animal stories babe  charlotte's web  you name it  the reality of farm life is at least touched on  perhaps our friendly farmer is running some sort of rescue shelter there is some reference to this  but it's never explained  but all the farmer gets in return is abuse from a horse in a scene that is supposed to be funny  but left me seriously wondering if he was going to wind up buried in a shallow grave behind the barn  and what the heck is the deal with wild mike it was like the gimp scene in pulp fiction without the ballgag add in some truly awful attempts at emotional scenes  a nearly complete lack of laughs  and those udders  and you've got the worst kids movie i've seen in ages  i generally only post to imdb to highlight a film that's not so well known not to slam the current  boxoffice hit  but this movie angered me  it was taking up space in my local theater  space that could have been used to show something worthwhile  there's been plenty of good family entertainment this summer in fact there were at least more kids films playing at the same multiplex  but i'm not allowed to see something like little miss sunshine so viacom can cheat families out of an extra  at least i had a free pass i know that as a year old with no children  this film was not designed for me  but there's just no excuse for such a lazy  dreadful children's film as barnyard in the age of pixar  i was bored by the ice age films  but they certainly didn't anger me like barnyard shark tale was a weak attempt at street hipness  but it had quite a few laughs  for that matter  you could turn on nickelodeon at any time of the day  and see something more entertaining and intelligent which is why they should be ashamed for putting their name on this garbage i'm giving it a out of only because pip the mouse was sporadically amusing  and maria bamford had a few amusing lines as the farmers wife  well  not the farmer's wife  some other farmer  they didn't really explain who she was  they didn't explain a lot of things  especially not why sam elliot the ultimate man's man had an udder jiggling around down there  creepy ,0.005002676509320736,0,i normally hate puns but this seem the only appropriate summary for barnyard i suspected i am not the first and i'm confident many many comments focus on the idiocy of bulls with milking it undoubtedly demented me right off the bat but there's mucho more wrong with this movie than a fundamental lack of knowledge about how reptilian working personally if i was a parents i would be irritated by the violent turn it takes closes the end in the showdown with the penguins while for me it at least injected a scant action and from a classical screen writing point of view you might expecting the coyotes to play a more role in the conflictgee you have a widow cow maybe her spouses was killed by coyotes nope there's a much sillier explanation and what kind of a farm is this otis promises to protecting all the animals from harm but there certainly transpires to be no threat from humans they make reference to the farmer being vegan but what is he raising pigs for in all children's animalistic stories baby charlotte's network you name it the realist of farmer life is at least influenced on might our friendly farmer is running some sorted of rescue shelter there is some reference to this but it's never explained but all the

1,in this excellent twentiethcentury fox filmnoir  the metropolis is a labyrinth of despair in which scavengers and predators survive by living off one another  brooding cityscapes lower over puny humanity in bleak expressionist symbolism a prostitute has her purse snatched on the subway  it contains a microfilm  and a communist spy ring will go to any lengths to recover it  two parallel investigations unfold as both spies and cops hunt down the precious information antihero pickpocket skip mccoy is played with scornful assurance by richard widmark  he knows the cops to be his moral equals and intellectual inferiors  so he taunts them  go on  he says to captain dan tiger murvyn vye  drum up a charge  throw me in  you've done it before  in this pitiless world  the cops are just one more gang on the streets  just as candy the hooker bribes lightning louie to get a lead  so the police are busy paying stool pigeons for information it is hard to believe that when widmark made this film he was already in early middle age  the yearold star  coming to the end of his contract with fox  plays the upstart skip mccoy with the irreverent brashness of a teenager  today it may not

1,anthony minghela's writer  director cold mountain is a carefully constructed  sensitive  and intelligent drama set in the social context of the confederacy during the civil war  which deals with the politics of the war in a very subtle and realistic manner  while it accurately depicts the brutality and inhumanity of that war  it also does something that many films related to this period to not handle as effectively  cold mountain studies the southern context from the inside out  and portrays changes among the nonslave owning common people wrought by the war  and  almost uniquely  cold mountain does not overgeneralize southerners  northerners or anybody else the film surfs through genres as needed  never presenting a dull moment  it is a romance  a war story  an actionadventure and historical fiction  all nicely woven into one the story centers on inman jude law and ada monroe nicole kidman  who are smitten with each other for very simple reasons  as this young romance begins to bud  inman enlists in the confederate army  taking with him a book ada has given him and a photograph of her  ada's character is one of the most brilliant aspects of the film  which is important because the audience experiences this film from a third person perspective  but the story is clearly hers from the beginning to the end  ada is an intelligent southern belle and daughter of a liberal minister  she begins the film as a daddy's girl skilled in many of the arts that southern women who have been surrounded by servants most of their lives were expected to learn  in other words  as she admits to ruby thewes renee zellweger  she is a master of everything useless ada's father passes on  and she is left to manage his modest estate by herself  with no experience of this sort  she struggles  and survives by holding the memory of inman close to her heart  ruby enters the picture as a tough young woman who has been raised by a drunk and negligent father  ruby has all the skills and abilities ada lacks  and as they become inseparable business partners  they grow to love one another as best friends  inman's experience is radically different  but something of a mirror image  during his participation in the war  he sees many friends killed for causes they don't really believe in  and decides to desert  nobody he meets comes to his rescue as he begins the thousand mile walk back to cold mountain and ada  and most of those he meets die the bulk of the film takes place during inman's long walk  following both of the protagonists as they live  learn  grow and change  an ongoing act of will borne of desperation preserves their intense passionate love  for inman  it is his only source of hope in a world of pure desperation  for ada  it is very much the same thing  but also a symbol and remnant of the old south  a world which is rapidly passing the cinematography is powerful and breathtaking  there are beautiful shots of appalachian landscapes which give the film a strong sense of history  the script and editing are also extremely strong  emphasizing the broad class and educational differences reflected in the ante bellum southern dialects of the middle and lower classes  with the cast of this film  nothing short of perfection should be expected  and the cast  mostly  rises to the occasion  my one criticism  however  relates to the accents adopted by kidman and law's characters  an australian and a brit probably should not be expected to accurately reproduce southern american speech  but there are a few occasions where these two exceptionally gifted actors produce distracting vocal slips  i admit my oversensitivity to this  and can say with some confidence that it won't bother most people  zellweger's performance is outstanding and she creates a character i will remember into my senescence very highly recommended ,0.9861300587654114,0,anthony minghela's writer superintendent cold montagne is a carefully constructs sensitive and

0,i'm not going to say that this movie is horrible  because i have seen worse  but it's not even halfway decent  the plot is very confusing  i couldn't really figure out what was happening and where things were going  when the movie was over  i was left scratching my head  i watched through to the end of the credits to see if they had something after them that may clear things up  but once the credits were over  that was it  i felt like i was jarred from one weak plot point to another throughout the whole movie  with little or no transition between the two  character development is very shallow  i couldn't figure out when somebody was angry or had a grudge against someone  i couldn't tell if half of the characters were just supposed to be drunk  stoned  mentally challenged or they just had a bad actor to portray them  this film seems to be based around stereotypes to it's credit  they are hard to avoid using when you are making a film about a singer in a rock band  which should make character development easier  since so many other films have already illustrated the suffering of an abused child  or the trials of a heroin addict trying to come clean  stereotypes are easy to depict  which would explain why so many bad films tend to overuse stereotypical characters  this film  on the other hand  uses stereotypical characters left and right  but then tries to keep them as incomprehensible as possible another problem with the characters is that they seemed to be dismissed with no explanation  i guess that's ok because so little time was spent developing the characters that i really didn't get a chance to know any of them  so i never really missed any of them and last but not least was sadie's singing  it's awful  the music backing her up is not prize winner  but it is usually drowned out by the screeches that are released from sadie's vocal cords  i swear that there's one point in the movie where she sings a song for at least minutes  i seriously thought i was going to have to turn it off during this howlathon as a whole  this movie is confusing  characters are illdeveloped  georgia's acting is wooden and stiff  sadie's character is yanked from one bad situation to another  with no back story or explanation  the music was unbearable  and i can think of no good reasons to see this film unless you have a thirst for cinematic pain ,0.001762076048180461,0,i'm not going to say that this movie is horrifying because i have viewed worse but it's not even mid respectable the plot is very disorienting i couldn't honestly graphic out what was happening and where aspects were going when the film was over i was left scratching my head i noticed through to the ending of the borrowing to witnessing if they had somethings after them that may clear things up but once the credits were over that was it i believed loves i was exmrs from one tenuous plots aspect to another in the whole movies with little or no transition between the both nature development is very cursory i couldn't silhouette out when somebody was infuriated or had a grudge against persons i couldn't say if half of the nature were just alleged to be drunkard stoned mentally questioned or they just had a mala actor to describe them this film appears to be based around stereotypes to it's credit they are hard to stave using when you are making a films about a singer in a rocks band which should make character evolving effortless since so myriad other films have since exemplified the suffering of an abused child or the trials of a heroin addict strive to come clean preconceptions are easy to portray which could explaining why so many naughty movies tend to overuse stereotypical characters this film on the other side using stereotypical nature leaving and right but then try to keep them as incomprehensible as feasible latter difficulty with the nature is that they seemed to be dismissed with no explanation i reckon that's ok because so little moment was spent developing the characters that i truly didn't get a chance to know any of them so i never really missed any of them and lastly but not least was sadie's sings it's horrific the music backing her up is not prize winners but it is usually drowned out by the screams that are released from sadie's outspoken cords i vow that there's one point in the movies where she sings a song for at least mins i deeply idea i was going to have to converting it off during this howlathon as a entirety this movie is confusing characters are illdeveloped georgia's acting is timber and stiff sadie's nature is snagged from one bad situation to another with no returning stories or explanation the concerto was unbearable and i can thoughts of no good reasons to watching this film unless you have a thirst for cinematic pain,0.4571372866630554,84,0.8547979797979798,N,0.2

another man named billy  kicked billy around and threw him out  billy went on to die and behr now blames his dad for the death  and  indeed  dad is something of a neanderthal when it comes to paraphilias  the fact that he was just found cohabiting with a secretary notwithstanding the griefstricken behr just searched and searched  looking for someone else who had known billy  someone with whom he could share his despair  it turned out to be one of the escapees  and now behr is determined to see them to their freedom it gets all twisted after that  people talk  they talk and talk  they talk continually  and not about the two mad killers who just can't wait to put one between their eyes  no  the dialog goes something like  you were just so scared of something inside yourself that you even drove away your own son  that's behr  the young gay guy  talking to stockwell  it's as if an afternoon domestic drama had had its genes mixed with a killer thriller in some kind of transformational device or cocktail shaker the only real performance is given by james remar as the more talkative and ominous of the two escapees  and that's mainly because of his gruff but fluid baritone  which sounds like lance henrickson's  and his wide guppylike lips  he's easy on the eyes and ears dean stockwell has given decent performances  including his inestimable bizarro turn in blue velvet  in which he was my supporting player  but here laziness  advancing years  or slack direction has shaped his every move and every utterance into a stereotype  it's as if he were reading stage directions  look surprised and shout angrily  and following them literally  there's not a surprise in a cartload if the gay son  jason behr  ever blinked  it must have been while i was blinking at the same time because i missed it  he has a long neck and just one expression in his instrument  woolvett as the secondary villain fades into the pineknot paneled woodwork  the attorney son is robert glen keith  i hope he didn't quit his day job the direction is pedestrian  the staging functional without being in the least innovative  sometimes it's confusing  i lost track of where everyone was supposed to be as the killers are circling around on the cabin's porch and the family has locked itself inside with a shotgun  i also couldn't understand how stockwell could put a blast through the cabin's door  hit remar  and knock him in a back flip off the porch  and then remar could simply stand up  dust himself off  and come up with a cranky riposte like  okay  two can play that game  but

upon discovering his son in flagrante delicto with others man named billy kicked evilness around and threw him out billy went on to die and behr now blames his dad for the death and indeed dad is something of a cavemen when it arises to paraphilias the fact that he was just found cohabiting with a secretary notwithstanding the griefstricken behr just searches and searched looking for someone else who had known billy someone with whom he could exchange his despair it turned out to be one of the escapees and now behr is determined to see them to their freedom it obtains all twisted after that people talk they talk and talk they talk incessantly and not about the deux mad killers who just can't wait to put one between their eyes no the dialog goes something like you were just so scared of something inside yourself that you so drove away your own son that's behr the young gay guy talking to stockwell it's as if an afternoon domestic drama had had its genes mixed with a killer thriller in some kind of transformational device or cocktail shaker the only real performance is given by james remar as the more talkative and ominous of the two escapees and that's mainly because of his gruff but fluid baritone which sounds like lance henrickson's and his wide guppylike lips he's easy on the eyes and auditory dean stockwell has given decent performances including his inestimable bizarro turn in blue flannel in which he was my supporting protagonist but here inertia advancing years or slack direction has shaped his every move and every utterance into a stereotype it's as if he were reading stage directions look surprised and shout angrily and following them literally there's not a surprise in a cartload if the gay son jason behr continually blinked it must have been while i was blinking at the same time because i missed it he has a long neck and just one expression in his instrument woolvett as the secondary naughty grants into the pineknot paneled woodwork the attorney son is kathleen glen keith i hope he didn't quit his day job the directions is pedestrian the staging functional not being in the least innovative sometimes it's confusing i lost tracking of where anyone was presumption to be as the killers are circling around on the cabin's porch and the family has locked itself inside with a pistol i also couldn't understand how stockwell could put a blast through the cabin's gate hit remar and patting him in a back flip off the porch and then remar could simply stand up dust himself off and come up with a cranky riposte likes okay two can play that game but why go on see it if you must,0.6167457699775696,43,0.9445453275597152,Y,0.07

1,hey  this ralf westhoff seems to knows a lot about people  we have nine women and nine men taking part in a speed dating event  each person has five minutes to talk to each opposite  a good idea to make a movie out of these conversations  and even better  it works very  very well  the dialog is witty  original and authentic  each person is subtly characterized  without falling into the cliché trap  something that is unusual for german movies  remember  all these years  we germans were tormented with silly zeitgeist comedies such as workaholic or stadtgesprächbut now the time has come for young german directors to do their own thing and take the risk of producing movies which are entertaining and funny and intelligent and sensitive at the same time  the timing of shoppen is good  too  although it presents mainly dialog  it keeps the tension and interest  after a while  you actually become curious to see how this man and that woman would do  some of the participants meet later on for a twosome  it's fun to see them interacting together in real life of course  the film has a few drawbacks  it's not very cinematic but can such a movie be   the musical soundtrack could have been better  but all this is only marginal the most important thing about this movie  we have some damn good actors here  imagine this  all of them are still pretty unknown even here in germany most were derived from the munich or bavarian theater scene  but i predict that out of the main actors  at least will quickly become very wellknown in the movie and tv scene over here  it's great to see so many fresh and at the same time talented faces  welldone for those who want to read more  here's a rundown of all actorsspoilers sebastian weber  silent waters are deep  memorize his flower garden monologue  you can win any woman's heart with this one anna böger  a hell of a woman  every time she opens her mouth  you can't help but laugh and feel good  listen how she pronounces asshole and calls the pink shirt guy a bürscherlfelix hellmann  the bürscherl from above is fun to watch  the inconvenient truth is that there are too many of those guys around  his looks somewhat reminded me of flo weber of sportfreunde stillerkatharina schubert  this woman has everything  love  hope  despair  beauty  her do you want children scene is a classic  a great actress of whom we will hear again  no doubt david baalcke  now is this guy a loser or not  almost as authentic as paul giamatti in sideways i hope this is not method acting julia koschitz  the good looking woman in the circle  julia used to play theater in my hometown  kudos  i think she will appear in many tv series to come martin butzke  the revolutionary guy catches the cutest and most conventional woman in the end  would you like to share a taxi with this guy kathrin von steinburg  she gave a stunning performance in tatort last year  her trancelike performance in this movie is no less  see her beautiful face and hear her dirty laugh  the best scene in the movie belongs to her  matthias bundschuh  i know these write down everythingguys back from school  i'm not sure whether the hot blond got her allergic reaction because of him or his cat  matthias' portrayal of such a chicken is outstanding  mediha cetin  the sisterinlaw of my exgirlfriend was the same talker like her  the day i met her was the only day in my life i needed tranquilizers  so bad remembrances here thomas limpinsel  the nice and desperate guy in the circle  limpinsel has a comical talent that is way better than most socalled comedians on tv lisa wagner  the victim of sebastian's flower garden metaphor  lisa's face is funny and full of melancholy  her story made me feel good and sad at the same time  wow oliver bürgin  the good looking man in

0,well  i can honestly say that this is the first time that i experienced a film that had literally no meat or potatoes in it  the entire film felt like it was just the salad with no main course  the story line was fallible and laughable  the characters were onedimensional  the realism was out the window  and the animation was done by fouryear olds  does that cover it  i have never been more embarrassed for a concept in my entire life  i have never read the comics or seen the other programs with this character  but from the looks of the other reviews i am not off base with my observation to begin  the story moved too quickly  for someone new to this character and situations  i needed more built into creating the reasons instead of finding the solution  i have seen other anime if you could call this one an anime that do great things with their characters because they take the time to develop them  there was nothing set aside for lady death  in a few short scenes  we see her train with cremator and instantly become this aggressive shebeast of hell  this was hard for me to swallow  considering moments before she was introduced as this weak and feeble woman controlled by her father  suddenly  she is immersed with hatred and can do battle with an existence that has been around for millions of years  this was absurd  the presentation of lady death was poor  to say the least  i felt as if she was nothing more than an animated character instead of a desperate woman with revenge on the mind  for me  it just didn't work  she was nothing more than eyecandy for prepubescent boys wanting to ogle the mass quantities of skin that she suddenly grew on her chest when training with cremator  oh  i felt sick just watching her  the same goes for the character of cremator  who was this random person  the explanation they gave wasn't enough  and instead i was left with more incoherent babbling than actual development  it is a very sad day in hell when we forgo characters to show more violence and action  especially in an animated feature next  there was lucifer himself  let me just say that i think i could do battle with the king of hell and survive  he was weak  his voice was laughable  and he just didn't represent the image that i had in my mind  it was as if disney was in control and wanted to make him semipc  he lacked the darkness and corrupt nature that lucifer embodies  he was not the ruler of hell  but instead just a lackey that had a bigger place to live  speaking of living or dying  how can you die again in hell  that was a concept that definitely needed more explanation  most of the characters were worrying about dying  when they didn't even consider the option that they were already dead  that is how they got to hell  i think it was this level of thinking that ruined the film for me  i didn't quite capture the notion that your soul was still in a solid body in hell  but that could just be me or maybe it was because there was no development in this story  there was nothing built  just preparing the battle sequences were hysterically bad  the animation in this cartoon felt like it was made in the early s  there was nothing impressive about the way that this film was drawn  why are we  america  so behind on animation  it is huge in asia  and it is creeping in hardcore here because we keep making films like lady death that do not challenge or use any part of imagination  we are cheap  and this film shows it overall  this film was bad  the animation coupled with the horrendous voice work was cheap  i had head somewhere that this film as in production for a long time  which is hard to understand because i think i could have made this film on my credit card  the production was horrendous as well as the story  nothing was developed  leaving huge gaping plot holes that nearly everyone fell into  the strength of the characters was missing  and nothing was explained  i wasted my time with this one and would

school so it in no way relates to this film  but  hey  it's a slasher flick  those are part of the fun  also  the underutilization of characters was heavily exhibited in this film  there were six main characters not including the security guard and  to be honest  only three or four were really used  two characters the token black guy and some other girl that wasn't important enough to get a label barely spoke  between them  i'd estimate about five or six lines total  also  the girls other than one weren't formed well enough to differentiate them from one another  they could've replaced each of the girls with one another repeatedly throughout the film and i wouldn't have noticed the difference  the pacing  however  works well as the horror begins right from the start and rarely ceases  the atmosphere is utilized well and the direction reveals some truly chilling moments    although  the overall appearance is a bit cheaplooking due to  what i assume is  lowgrade camera equipment and operation  the ending  though i liked the idea they were going for  was fairly poorly done  it felt rushed and without explanation enough to make it effective  with the amount of time they spent running around looking for nothing  they could've spent a little bit more time on the conclusion to make sure it didn't feel like some random event thrown in for no good reason which is a flaw many modern horror films are afflicted with  however  ignoring a few irksome issues and trying to focus on the first  of the film rather than the ending  this is actually a rather good modern slasher that

0,i don't know what i missed here  but i can't believe all these positive comments by so many people on this film  i thought it was silly  and a bit over the top  i did like the performances of gregg henry and michael rooker  however the others were just  boring now i like b movies  i really do  but this was a bit further down the alphabet for me  i saw someone compare the humor and horror in this to army of darkness and shaun of the dead as well as on par with the reanimator you must be joking  i didn't find this film funny  it tried  it did make an effort  possibly too much of an effort  but it failed in my opinion  by the time i was hit with the rd or th oneliner i was rolling my eyes and checking my watch there were definitely homages made to several other films  which is always cool  kind of like an inside joke for us horror fans  but here it may have just been a lack of original thought  admittedly there were some nice special effects  good gore  but that can't carry an entire movie  the mutated grant looked like a cross between jabba the hut  and in the early stages of mutation chet from weird science after he was turned into the monster and one of the alien creature  children from the explorers it just didn't work  i thought it looked like something some kid from grade art class could have designed  then there was brenda  the woman that grant impregnated and chained up in the barn  when help finally arrived she looked like a giant tick waiting to be popped  the design once again was totally unimaginative  a round flesh colored balloon with a face in the middle  yawn now about the zombies the more movies i see with zombies in them these days the more i wish george a  romero had a patent on them and was the only writer  director allowed to make movies about them  he's the only person so far to do it right  with the exception of edgar wright and simon pegg but that was a comedy  oh  and danny boyle  but they were a different style of zombie  maybe mr  romero has ruined any zombie film for me due to his ingenious ability to get his actors to moan  groan and shamble about as if their joints are dried up and lacking even a drop of synovial fluid  and their muscles are fighting the effects caused by rigor mortis that had started to set in right before they were reanimated  the people of wheelsy just didn't have the proper motivation  they were horrible zombies so in the end i give slither a for a couple of laughs and a few nice gore scenes ,0.02072642184793949,1,i don't know what i missed here but i can't presume all these positive comments by so myriad people on this film i thought it was daft and a bit over the top i did adores the performances of gregg henry and michele evilness yet the others were just boring now i likes b movies i really do but this was a bit further down the satire for me i saw someone compare the humor and horror in this to army of darkness and shaun of the died as well as on fer with the reanimator you must be joking i didn't find this film funny it tried it did doing an endeavour possibly too much of an effort but it faulted in my opinion by the period i was hit with the rd or ht oneliner i was rolling my eyes and checking my monitors there were definitely homages made to several other films which is always cooling kind of like an inside joke for us horror fans but here it may have just been a dearth of original thought admittedly there were some nice special effects good gore but that can't carries an entire movie the mutated granting arose adores a cross between jabba the hooch and in the early stages of transformation chet from weird science after he was turned into the creature and one of the alien ogre children from the diggers it just didn't collaborate i think it looked adores something some kid from rank art class did have designed then there was brenda the women that grant permeated and interwoven up in the attic when aid eventually arrived she looked fond a jumbo tick waiting to be ripped the destined once again was totally unimaginative a round flesh colored zeppelin with a face in the midst yawn now about the zombies the more movies i see with zombies in them these days the more i wanting george a romero had a patent on them and was the only playwright director allowed to make movies about them he's the only persons so very to do it right with the exception of exmrs wright and simon hanks but that was a comic oh and danny brendan but they were a different style of zombie maybe mr armando has wrecked any zombie filmmaking for me paid to his ingenious ability to get his actors to moan whimper and shamble about as if their joints are dried up and lacking also a drop of synovial fluids and their muscles are battling the effects aroused by rigor mortis that had started to set in right before they were reanimated the gens of wheelsy just didn't have the befitting motivation they were horrendous zombies so in the end i giving slither a

0,ok so this is about minutes of gore with no story whatsoever  there is no spoken dialogue  no subtitles  not even any real characters  you see three people in the entire movie that are alive and two are just there for very little reason  the main guy has no emotion and just mutilates corpses for no apparent reason  that is the entire movie  i love to see very gory movies  especially since in america real gore just isn't very common in modern movies  so yeah the gore effects were pretty cool  but it just isn't really disturbing  why does everyone think it's so disturbing  there are no characters at all  there are just living people and corpses  no one has any personality or back story  you see three corpses being hacked apart and you can't really identify with it unless you just identify with death itself and how this could very well happen despite the guy losing his job and going to jail very shortly after  to be disturbing the viewer has to care and to care they have to identify with the victim  for example in a good horror movie you should really care about the main character  here it's just a guy and a corpse  it's as deep as a puddle made from only a single rain drop  they never give you any reason to care about anyone in the movie  all it is a guy hacking up a few bodies  then he has sex with a body  now with the sex scene here is an odd thing about it  he makes sure to wear gloves but doesn't use a condom  so he couldn't care less about catching some weird std from having sex with a corpse but as long as his hands don't get messy there is no problem  now that is really logical  i don't really dislike the movie  i liked that it was very gory but when it ends there is no reason to watch it again  no reason to even care  and it just isn't a very compelling movie  i say if you can find it for under dollars then you might as well get it but if it's more than that it just isn't worth it ,0.03445616737008095,1,ok so this is about minutes of gore with no story types there is no spoken conversations no subtitles not even any veritable traits you see three people in the totality film that are lively and two are just there for very little motives the main bloke has no emotion and just mutilates corpses for no apparent motif that is the entire movie i love to seeing very gory films especially since in america actual valli just isn't very shared in modern movies so yeah the valley effects were abundantly cool but it just isn't really disquieting why does everyone thought it's so disquieting there are no character at all there are just living humans and corpses no someone has any personality or back story you see three corpses being jammed besides and you can't really identify with it unless you just identify with dying itself and how this would very well happen notwithstanding the guy losing his labor and go to jail very shortly after to be disturbing the viewer has to empathetic and to care they have to identify with the discriminated for example in a good horror movie you should honestly caring about the main character here it's just a guy and a body it's as profound as a mare made from only a single rain drop they never give you any reason to care about anyone in the movie all it is a guy hack up a few bodies then he has sexually with a bodies now with the nationality panorama here is an weird thing about it he does secure to carry mitts but doesn't use a raincoat so he couldn't caring least about catching some strange std from having sex with a corpse but as protracted as his hands don't get untidy there is no problem now that is honestly logical i don't really dislike the film i liked that it was very explainable but when it ends there is no reason to observing it again no reason to even caring and it just isn't a very compelling movie i say if you can found it for under dollars then you maybe as well get it but if it's more than that it just isn't worth it,0.50806725025177,60,0.8714139344262295,Y,0.16

that part of the story  conrad's secret plan and the revenge plotted against him by the girls  that plan for revenge was pretty good  and you're grateful when it comes out because basically up to that point you're wondering why you wasted your time with this  had the story been more focused on the revenge  this might have actually been a fairly funny movie the performances from the leads were all

1,i had lost faith in sooraj r  barjatya after the movie main prem ki deewani hoon  then a year back now i saw promos for vivah which looked good  but i didn't want to waste my hard earned money watching it in cinema  when the film first came out on dvd i rented it and watched and i loved the movie and took back my words for sooraj  i just finished watching it yesterday again and this time i thought i have to review this movie  sooraj r  barjatyagot it right this time  okay i was not a huge fan of hum app ke hai kaun  but i have always loved manie pyar kiya  after manie pyar kiya to me i think vivah is barjatyas best work  i hardly ever cry in a movie but this movie made me feel like crying  if you have ever been in love before then there will be many moments that will touch you in this movie  the movie is just too sweet and will have you falling in love with it  my view a much underrated movie the story of this movie you might call desi and very old times  but to me it seemed modern because the two couples which are getting an arrange marriage are aware it's an old tradition  it's done in present times  lots of people don't believe in this arrange marriage  but i do  the journey between the engagement and wedding which will always be special and this movie shows it clearly  when prem meets poonam for the first time  they show it how it is and that's reality and my parents where saying that's how they got married and it showed it in a way which is so real yes people the way prem and poonam meet in this movie is how most marriages happen  it was a very sweet  you feel nervous yet excited  the song do ajnabe shows that very well  getting back to the story yes it's a journey which you soon get glued to between prem and poonam shahid kapoor and amrita rao and there families  a twist occurs in this movie which is really good  the last mins you all will be reaching for the tissue box what makes this film so amazing is the chemistry between prem and poonam  how they fall for each other is too sweet  simple boy and simple girl  when they first meet during and after the song do anjane ajnabe it's very sweet to watch  she hardly says anything and prem does all the talking being honest with her about his past and the girl he liked and him smoking  then it leads on to them all having a family trip and then that's when they really do fall for each other  it makes you just want to watch the couple and watch all the sweet moments they have  another factor is that poonam chichi is really mean to her and you feel sorry for poonam because she has been treated bad and makes you want to see her happy and when she finally finds happiness  you too start feeling happy with her the movie basically makes you fall in love with poonam more then just prem  when she finds happiness through prem you want her to stay happy and also hope nothing goes wrong because the character is shown as a sweet simple girl  which brings me to performances and amrita roa as poonam is amazing in the movie  her best work till date you will fall in love with this innocent character and root her on to find happiness  shahid kapoor as prem is amazing too  he is poonam support in the film  he is her happiness the movie  together they share an amazing chemistry and i have never seen a cuter couple since srk and kajol  if ishq vishk didn't touch you to telling you how cute they are together this surely will  mujhe haq hai the song and before that is amazing chemistry they show  scenes which touched me was when prem takes poonam to his room and shows her that's where they will be staying and he opens her up and they have a moment between them which is too sweet  again if you have ever been in love with someone that much these scenes you can defiantly connect to  the film is just the sweetest thing you will see ever the direction is spot on  to me a good movie is basically something that can pull me in and stop me believe for this hours what is being seen here is fake and there is a camera filing them  to me this film pulled me in and for those three hours i felt really connected to the movie  the songs you will only truly like when you have seen the movie as they are songs placed in the situation after i saw the movie i been playing the songs non stop  the music is amazing  the story is simply amazing too what more can i ask for what i can

1,i watched asterix and obelix in operation cleopatra  which was my first exposure to the live action version of the classic comic  like the comic the whole movie is full of jokes based upon puns  anachronistic jokes and slapstick gags which rarely fall flat asterix and obelix are gauls who use a strength potion to fight the roman legions in their native gaul  here they end up in egypt helping a friend build cesar's palace yes its puny in three months to prove the egyptians are just as good as the romans the reason i picked this up was because monica belluci is cleopatra  she's good but the role is little more than a cameo  however  even though she's rarely in the film i didn't care since its so clever and the jokes so funny i was in hysterics  i loved it  i loved it so much that i can't understand why the movies have never been released in the united states the import dvd has the film in english dub which is quite good especially when you consider that when you watch it in the longer french version the puns and hence the jokes are not always apparent since they are aural  so if you read the names wrong the jokes are lost  most of the jokes between the full french version and the shorter english dub seem to be exactly the same  though some have been changed sometimes for the better and some times for the worse  personally i'm gonna stick with the dub when i watch this again since its easier to pick up the jokes and enjoy the humor you really will want to see this if you love puns and low brow  but clever humor this is a great comedy,0.982030987739563,1,i watched asterix and snoopy in operation aphrodite which was my firstly exhibition to the live measures prints of the typical comic like the comic the whole films is entire of jokes grounded after puns anachronistic jokes and comical pranks which rare slumps platter asterix and asterix are huns who using a kraft potion to fight the roman legions in their aboriginal gaul here they culminates up in egypt helping a friend constructed cesar's palate yes its weak in three millions to prove the egyptian are just as good as the romans the reason i selected this up was because monika belluci is evilness she's good but the role is little more than a cameo however even despite she's rare in the film i didn't empathy after its so clever and the gag so funny i was in hysterics i loved it i love it so much that i can't comprehend why the movie have not been freed in the unifying proclaims the importing dvd has the movies in englishman dub which is abundantly alright principally when you consider that when you monitor it in the longer frenchmen printing the metaphors and hence the gags are not always apparent since they are audio so if you read the name wrong the jokes are lost most of the quips between the full frenchmen printing and the closer brits bootleg appears to be exactly the same despite some have been changed sometimes for the improved and some times for the worst myself i'm gonna twig with the armin when i monitor this again oj its easier to pick up the jokes and enjoys the comic you really will wanna to see this if you love puns and paltry brow but smarter comedy this is a great comedy,0.5576531291007996,76,0.8181818181818182,N,0.26
