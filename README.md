# Vulnerability of Natural Language Classifiers to Evolutionary Generated Adversarial Text

## ToDo
-

## Datasets

---
### Implementations
- [BERT-Attack](https://github.com/LinyangLee/BERT-Attack)

---
### Colab notebooks
- 
--- 



Computing Science honours dissertation project aimed at generating adversarial examples against a sentiment analysis model, using genetic algorithms. 

### To run the code, run the Jupyter notebooks in the following order
(You will need a machine with a decent NVIDIA GPU to build and test the model)
- 01-Build_model_and_Distance_Matrix.ipynb
- 02-Generate_Attacks.ipynb
- 03-Stats.ipynb
